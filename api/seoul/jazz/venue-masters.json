    "raw": "To convert an SVG string into a PNG image object using Python, you can use the `cairosvg` library to render the SVG to PNG bytes, and then `Pillow` (PIL) to open these bytes as an image object.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n```bash\npip install cairosvg Pillow\n```\n\nHere's the Python function to perform the conversion:\n\n```python\nimport cairosvg\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\ndef svg_string_to_png_image(svg_string: str) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an SVG string to a PIL Image.Image object.\n\n    Args:\n        svg_string (str): The SVG content as a string.\n\n    Returns:\n        PIL.Image.Image: A Pillow Image object representing the rendered PNG.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Convert SVG string to PNG bytes using cairosvg\n        # The bytestring argument takes the SVG content directly.\n        png_bytes = cairosvg.svg2png(bytestring=svg_string)\n\n        # Open the PNG bytes with Pillow to create an Image object\n        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(png_bytes))\n\n        return image\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error converting SVG to PNG image: {e}\")\n        raise\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example SVG string: a simple red circle\n    sample_svg_string = \"\"\"\n    <svg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n      <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" fill=\"lightblue\"/>\n      <circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"100\" r=\"80\" fill=\"red\" stroke=\"blue\" stroke-width=\"5\"/>\n      <text x=\"50\" y=\"105\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"20\" fill=\"white\">Hello SVG!</text>\n    </svg>\n    \"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        # Convert the SVG string to a PIL Image object\n        png_image = svg_string_to_png_image(sample_svg_string)\n\n        # Now 'png_image' is a PIL.Image.Image object\n        print(f\"Successfully converted SVG to an image of type: {type(png_image)}\")\n        print(f\"Image format: {png_image.format}\")\n        print(f\"Image size: {png_image.size}\")\n\n        # You can now display the image (if in an environment that supports it)\n        # png_image.show()\n\n        # Or save the image to a file\n        output_filename = \"output_image.png\"\n        png_image.save(output_filename)\n        print(f\"Image saved as '{output_filename}'\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during example usage: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`cairosvg.svg2png(bytestring=svg_string)`**: This is the core of the conversion. `cairosvg` takes the SVG content (provided as a string to `bytestring`) and renders it into a PNG format. It returns the raw binary data of the PNG image.\n2.  **`io.BytesIO(png_bytes)`**: Since `Pillow`'s `Image.open()` function typically expects a file path or a file-like object, we wrap the `png_bytes` (which are just raw bytes) in an `io.BytesIO` object. This makes the bytes behave like an in-memory binary file.\n3.  **`Image.open(...)`**: `Pillow` then reads the PNG data from the `io.BytesIO` object and constructs a `PIL.Image.Image` object, which you can then manipulate, save, or display.",

    "raw": "Asking good questions is a superpower that unlocks better information, deeper understanding, and more effective problem-solving. It's a skill that can be developed and refined.\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide on how to ask good questions:\n\n---\n\n### **Core Principles of Asking Good Questions**\n\n1.  **Be Clear and Concise:** Get straight to the point without unnecessary jargon or rambling.\n2.  **Be Specific and Focused:** Avoid vagueness. The more precise your question, the more precise the answer will be.\n3.  **Provide Context:** Explain *why* you're asking, what you've tried, or what your goal is.\n4.  **Do Your Homework:** Don't ask what you can easily find out yourself.\n5.  **Know Your Audience:** Tailor your question to the knowledge and expertise of the person you're asking.\n6.  **Define Your Purpose:** What kind of answer are you looking for? A solution, an explanation, advice, confirmation, or just brainstorming?\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Steps to Formulate Good Questions**\n\n#### **1. Before You Ask:**\n\n*   **Clarify Your Own Thinking:** What exactly is confusing you? What problem are you trying to solve? Spend a few moments framing the issue in your own mind.\n*   **Do Preliminary Research:**\n    *   **Google it:** A quick search often reveals immediate answers or common solutions.\n    *   **Check documentation/FAQs:** If it's about a product or service, consult its official resources.\n    *   **Look for similar situations:** Has anyone else asked this before (e.g., on forums, within your team's knowledge base)?\n*   **Identify What You *Already* Know:** This helps you avoid asking for information you already possess and allows you to build on your existing knowledge.\n*   **Identify What You *Need* to Know:** What's the specific missing piece of information?\n\n#### **2. Crafting the Question:**\n\n*   **Start with the \"What\" or \"How\":**\n    *   *Instead of:* \"I'm having trouble with my report.\" (Too vague)\n    *   *Ask:* \"How do I generate a monthly sales report that includes gross revenue, net profit, and customer acquisition costs?\" (Specific, action-oriented)\n*   **Add \"Why\" (Context):**\n    *   Explain the background of your problem or the goal you're trying to achieve.\n    *   *Example:* \"I'm trying to integrate the new API (v2) into our existing system. I'm receiving a `401 Unauthorized` error, even though I'm using the provided API key. My goal is to retrieve customer data for our dashboard.\"\n*   **Show What You've Tried (Effort):**\n    *   This demonstrates you've put in effort and helps the answerer avoid suggesting things you've already done.\n    *   *Example (continuing from above):* \"...I've already double-checked the API key for typos, ensured it's enabled in the developer console, and confirmed the request headers match the documentation's example.\"\n*   **Be Specific About the Error/Issue:**\n    *   If it's a technical problem, include error messages, code snippets, screenshots, and exact steps to reproduce the issue.\n    *   *Example:* \"When I click the 'Submit' button, nothing happens, and the browser's developer console shows `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined at submitForm.js:15`.\"\n*   **Use Open-Ended Questions for Deeper Insights (and Closed-Ended for Specific Facts):**\n    *   **Open-Ended:** Encourage detailed answers and discussion. (e.g., \"What are your thoughts on...\", \"How did you approach...\", \"Can you elaborate on...\")\n        *   *Good for:* brainstorming, strategic discussions, understanding motivations.\n    *   **Closed-Ended:** Elicit a \"yes\" or \"no\" or a short, factual answer.\n        *   *Good for:* confirming facts, quick decisions. (e.g., \"Is the deadline Friday?\", \"Did you receive the email?\")\n        *   *Pro-tip:* Sometimes, start with an open question, then follow up with closed ones to narrow down.\n*   **One Question at a Time (if possible):**\n    *   If you have multiple distinct questions, separate them clearly (e.g., with bullet points). This makes it easier for the answerer to address each point.\n    *   *Instead of:* \"How do I fix the database, and when is the server update, and what about the new feature?\"\n    *   *Ask:*\n        *   \"How can I resolve the 'Duplicate Entry' error in the `users` table?\"\n        *   \"What is the scheduled date and time for the next server update?\"\n        *   \"Could you provide an update on the status of the new 'XYZ' feature?\"\n*   **Avoid Emotional Language:** Keep your questions neutral and objective.\n*   **Proofread:** Ensure clarity, correct grammar, and spelling.\n\n#### **3. After You Ask:**\n\n*   **Listen Actively / Read Carefully:** Pay full attention to the answer.\n*   **Ask Clarifying Follow-Up Questions:** If the initial answer isn't clear or raises new points, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.\n    *   \"So, if I understand correctly, you're suggesting X because of Y?\"\n    *   \"Could you explain what you mean by 're-indexing the database'?\"\n*   **Show Appreciation:** Thank the person for their time and help.\n*   **Provide Feedback (Optional):** Let the person know if their answer was helpful and how you used the information. This encourages them to help you again in the future.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of Good vs. Bad Questions:**\n\n| Bad Question                                       | Good Question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| \"My code isn't working.\"                           | \"I'm trying to make an HTTP request using `fetch` in JavaScript, but I'm getting a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error. The console output shows `GET https://api.example.com/data net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`. I've checked the URL for typos and confirmed my internet connection is stable. How can I debug this further?\"                                            |\n| \"What should we do about marketing?\"               | \"For our new B2B SaaS product targeting small businesses, what are the most effective lead generation strategies we should prioritize in the first six months, considering our limited budget and focus on content marketing?\"                                                                                                                                    |\n| \"Tell me about climate change.\"                    | \"Considering the recent IPCC report, what are the three most impactful policy changes governments could implement in the next decade to accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources and mitigate global warming, specifically within industrialized nations?\"                                                                                         |\n| \"How do I fix this error?\"                         | \"I'm compiling a C++ program with g++ on Ubuntu 20.04 and receiving the error `undefined reference to 'MyClass::myMethod()'`. I've included `MyClass.h` and linked `MyClass.o` during compilation. What are common causes for this specific linker error, and how can I ensure all necessary object files are correctly linked?\" |\n| \"What do you think about AI in the future?\"        | \"Given the rapid advancements in generative AI, what do you foresee as the biggest ethical challenges that need to be addressed in the next 5-10 years concerning data privacy and intellectual property, especially for businesses leveraging these technologies?\"                                                                                       |\n\n---\n\nBy consistently applying these principles, you'll not only get better answers but also demonstrate respect for others' time and expertise, fostering more productive interactions.",

    "raw": "Detecting AI-generated content is becoming increasingly challenging as models become more sophisticated. However, there are still common \"tells\" or patterns you can look for. It's rarely a single factor, but rather a combination of these elements that indicates AI authorship.\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide on what to look for:\n\n---\n\n## What to Look For: Red Flags for AI-Generated Content\n\n### I. Style & Tone\n\n1.  **Generic, Polished, but Bland Language:**\n    *   **Overly Smooth:** The text flows perfectly, often without a single grammatical error or awkward phrasing. It feels *too* clean.\n    *   **Lack of Unique Voice/Personality:** Absence of quirks, slang (unless specifically prompted), humor, sarcasm, or strong personal opinions. It often sounds like it could have been written by anyone.\n    *   **Corporate Jargon/Buzzwords:** Frequent use of terms like \"synergy,\" \"optimality,\" \"robust,\" \"comprehensive,\" \"paradigm,\" \"leverage,\" \"holistic,\" \"scalable,\" \"innovative,\" \"disruptive.\"\n    *   **Objective/Neutral Stance:** Even when discussing a controversial topic, the tone remains largely dispassionate, presenting both sides without genuine analysis or a clear stance.\n\n2.  **Repetitive Phrasing & Ideas:**\n    *   **Circular Arguments:** The text may restate the same point using slightly different words, especially in longer pieces, without adding new substance.\n    *   **Redundant Transitions:** Over-reliance on standard transition words like \"Furthermore,\" \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" \"However,\" \"Consequently,\" \"Therefore,\" often in a predictable pattern.\n    *   **Formulaic Structure:** Predictable intro-body-conclusion structure, often with bullet points or numbered lists to break down information, even when a more fluid structure might be natural for human writing.\n\n3.  **Lack of Personal Experience or Anecdote:**\n    *   AI doesn't have lived experiences. While it can generate plausible-sounding anecdotes, they often feel generic, cliché, or lack the specific, messy details that characterize genuine human stories.\n    *   Absence of \"I remember when...\", \"In my experience...\", or \"My opinion is...\" (unless explicitly told to adopt a persona, and even then, it can feel superficial).\n\n### II. Content & Information\n\n1.  **Vague Generalities & Lack of Specificity:**\n    *   **High-Level Summaries:** AI excels at summarizing existing information but can struggle with deep dives into niche or specialized topics without very specific prompting.\n    *   **Avoidance of Concrete Examples:** While it can list examples, they might feel generic rather than drawn from a specific, real-world context.\n    *   **Superficial Analysis:** It can describe and explain, but often lacks the critical thinking, nuanced interpretation, or original insight that a human expert would bring.\n\n2.  **Factual Errors or \"Hallucinations\":**\n    *   **Confabulation:** AI models can confidently \"make up\" facts, dates, names, sources, or quotes that sound plausible but are entirely false. This is a significant red flag, especially for newer or less reliable models.\n    *   **Outdated Information:** Depending on the training data cutoff, AI might not have access to the most current events, research, or statistics.\n\n3.  **Predictable Information Flow:**\n    *   **Common Knowledge Only:** The content tends to stick to widely accepted information rather than revealing obscure facts, innovative solutions, or challenging conventional wisdom.\n    *   **\"Textbook\" Explanations:** Explanations often resemble an encyclopedia entry or textbook summary, clean but lacking unique perspective.\n\n### III. Language & Mechanics\n\n1.  **Impeccable (Sometimes *Too* Impeccable) Grammar and Spelling:**\n    *   While humans make typos or occasional grammatical slips, AI text is almost always flawless in basic mechanics. This can paradoxically be a sign, especially in contexts where minor human error is common.\n    *   However, be aware that humans often edit AI output, correcting any minor issues.\n\n2.  **Advanced Vocabulary Used Without Nuance:**\n    *   AI has a vast vocabulary, but sometimes uses sophisticated words in slightly awkward or forced ways, as if it's prioritizing synonym variety over precise meaning.\n    *   The vocabulary might be consistently high-level, even for topics or audiences where simpler language would be more natural.\n\n3.  **Standard Sentence Structure:**\n    *   While capable of varied sentence structures, the overall rhythm can sometimes feel uniform, lacking the occasional intentional short, punchy sentence or complex, winding sentence that a human writer might use for stylistic effect.\n\n### IV. External & Contextual Clues\n\n1.  **Speed of Production:**\n    *   If a lengthy report, detailed article, or complex code was generated in minutes, it's a strong indicator of AI involvement.\n\n2.  **Source & Author:**\n    *   **Unknown or New Author:** If the content comes from a new blog, social media account, or author with no prior work, AI generation is a possibility.\n    *   **Quantity Over Quality:** Websites or authors that churn out a massive volume of content quickly might be using AI.\n\n3.  **Consistency Across Platforms:**\n    *   If an individual's online persona feels very different from their written output (e.g., someone known for informal language suddenly produces perfectly formal, generic articles), it could be a clue.\n\n---\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n*   **No Single Smoking Gun:** AI detection is rarely about one factor. It's about a confluence of these indicators.\n*   **AI is Evolving:** Models are constantly improving at mimicking human style and nuance, making detection harder.\n*   **Human-AI Collaboration:** Many pieces of content are now a mix of human writing and AI assistance (e.g., AI generating a draft, human editing it, or vice versa). This blurs the lines significantly.\n*   **False Positives/Negatives:** Some human writing *is* generic, bland, or error-free. Conversely, some AI can be prompted to produce very specific, opinionated, or even \"flawed\" content.\n*   **AI Detection Tools Are Unreliable:** Many AI detection software tools are inaccurate and frequently produce false positives, especially with edited AI content or well-written human content. Rely more on critical human analysis.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you'll be better equipped to critically evaluate content and make an informed judgment about its likely origin.",

    "raw": "W.W. Jacobs' \"The Monkey's Paw,\" first published in 1902, is a masterful and chilling short story that stands as a classic of horror fiction. It's renowned for its psychological tension, masterful use of suspense, and its enduring cautionary tale about the dangers of tampering with fate.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n---\n\n### Plot Summary\n\nThe story opens on a dark and stormy night at the cozy, yet somewhat isolated, home of the White family: Mr. White, Mrs. White, and their grown son, Herbert. Their evening is interrupted by the arrival of an old friend, Sergeant-Major Morris, who has just returned from a long stint in British India.\n\nMorris entertains the Whites with tales of his travels and, with some reluctance, introduces them to a strange, dried monkey's paw. He explains its origin: an old fakir (a Muslim ascetic or mendicant monk) placed a spell upon it, granting three separate men three wishes each, intending to show that \"fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow.\" Morris himself admits to having had his three wishes, and they brought him great sorrow, causing him to wish for death. He tried to burn the paw, but Mr. White rescued it.\n\nDespite Morris's dire warnings, Mr. White, intrigued and a bit skeptical, buys the paw from him. Morris departs, leaving the Whites alone with the cursed object. Herbert, light-hearted and joking, suggests his father wish for money. Mr. White, thinking of a paltry two hundred pounds to pay off his mortgage, makes the wish.\n\nThe paw twists in his hand, and he imagines a \"hideous simian\" face in the fire. The family is unnerved but ultimately dismisses it as imagination. The next morning, Herbert goes off to work. Later that day, a well-dressed man arrives at their door, representing Maw and Meggins, Herbert's employer. He delivers the news that Herbert has been caught in machinery and killed. As a gesture of goodwill, the company offers Mr. and Mrs. White compensation: two hundred pounds.\n\nThe Whites are shattered by grief. Weeks pass, filled with unbearable sorrow. Mrs. White, maddened by her loss, suddenly remembers the paw and demands that Mr. White wish Herbert alive again. Mr. White is terrified by the prospect of seeing his son's mutilated corpse, but Mrs. White's desperation forces his hand. He reluctantly makes the second wish.\n\nThey wait in terrifying silence. After a long, agonizing period, there is a soft knock at the door. Mrs. White, overcome with hope, rushes downstairs to open it, struggling with the high bolt. Mr. White, however, is paralyzed by fear, knowing what might be outside. He frantically searches for the paw, remembering his third wish. As Mrs. White finally manages to unbolt the door, Mr. White finds the paw and, just before she can open it completely, screams his third and final wish.\n\nThe knocking ceases abruptly. Mrs. White opens the door to an empty, silent street, illuminated by a single flickering street lamp.\n\n### Key Characters\n\n1.  **Mr. White:** The protagonist. He is initially curious, adventurous, and somewhat dismissive of the supernatural. He acts impulsively in acquiring the paw and making the first wish. As the story progresses, he becomes increasingly fearful and burdened by the consequences of his actions, ultimately making the difficult and horrific final decision. He represents the human desire to control fate and the tragic realization of its folly.\n2.  **Mrs. White:** A loving, practical, and somewhat superstitious wife and mother. She is deeply affected by Herbert's death, and her grief drives her to desperate, reckless actions (demanding the second wish). Her character highlights the destructive power of sorrow and the desperation it can engender.\n3.  **Herbert White:** The Whites' only son. He is portrayed as cheerful, humorous, and a bit skeptical of the paw's power. He is the immediate victim of the first wish, and his death serves as the catalyst for the rest of the story's tragic events.\n4.  **Sergeant-Major Morris:** A mysterious, world-weary soldier who serves as the bringer of the cursed object and its initial warning. He represents the voice of experience and wisdom regarding the supernatural, having suffered his own sorrows from the paw.\n\n### Major Themes\n\n1.  **Fate vs. Free Will:** This is the central conflict. The fakir's curse is explicitly designed to prove that \"fate ruled people's lives.\" Each wish granted by the paw directly interferes with the natural order, only for fate to reassert itself in a crueler, more twisted way. The story argues that attempting to change destiny only leads to suffering.\n2.  **The Danger of Tampering with the Supernatural:** The paw is not benevolent. It grants wishes, but always with a terrible, unforeseen cost. It warns against dabbling in forces beyond human comprehension and control, suggesting that such interference is inherently dangerous.\n3.  **Grief and Loss:** The story profoundly explores the destructive power of grief. Mrs. White's profound sorrow drives her to a state of near madness, compelling her husband to make the terrifying second wish. The story shows how loss can warp judgment and lead to even greater despair.\n4.  **Consequences of Actions/Unintended Consequences:** Every wish has a devastating, ironic outcome. The seemingly innocuous wish for money leads directly to Herbert's death. The wish for Herbert's return brings unimaginable horror. The story is a stark reminder that even seemingly good intentions can have catastrophic results when interacting with forces beyond understanding.\n5.  **Greed and Desire:** While the first wish is framed as paying off a mortgage, it stems from a desire for an easier life, a material gain. The story suggests that such desires, when pursued through unnatural means, can lead to suffering.\n\n### Symbolism\n\n*   **The Monkey's Paw:** Symbolizes corrupted power, forbidden knowledge, man's futile attempt to control destiny, and the insidious nature of wishing for material gain. Its dried, grotesque appearance reflects the horror it embodies.\n*   **The Number Three:** The three wishes, granted to three men, leading to three tragic outcomes, creates an ominous, cyclical pattern of misfortune.\n*   **The Gloomy, Stormy Weather:** Establishes a foreboding atmosphere from the very beginning, mirroring the dark events to unfold.\n\n### Literary Devices and Style\n\n*   **Foreshadowing:** Jacobs masterfully builds suspense through subtle hints. Morris's reluctance to discuss the paw, his grim warnings, his attempt to burn it, and Mr. White seeing a \"hideous simian\" face in the fire after the first wish all foreshadow the terrible events.\n*   **Suspense:** The story is a masterclass in building tension. The slow reveal of the paw's nature, the agonizing wait after the first wish, the knock at the door, and Mrs. White's struggle with the bolt all contribute to a palpable sense of dread. The horror is largely psychological, relying on what the reader imagines rather than explicit gore.\n*   **Irony:** The wishes are granted, but always with a cruel, ironic twist that utterly negates the desired outcome. The money comes at the cost of Herbert's life. The return of Herbert would be as a horrifying, reanimated corpse.\n*   **Ambiguity:** The ending is famously ambiguous. We never see what was at the door. This leaves the reader to imagine the worst, enhancing the psychological horror far more effectively than any explicit description could.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Jacobs excels at creating a dark, claustrophobic, and unsettling atmosphere, using details like the isolated house, the stormy weather, and the flickering firelight.\n\n### Conclusion: Why It's a Classic\n\n\"The Monkey's Paw\" remains a timeless classic for several reasons:\n*   **Universal Warning:** Its central message about the dangers of unchecked desire and meddling with fate resonates across generations.\n*   **Masterful Suspense:** It's a prime example of how to build horror through psychological tension and implication rather than overt violence.\n*   **Psychological Depth:** It delves into the raw, destructive power of grief and the agonizing choices born from desperation.\n*   **Enduring Image:** The image of the dried monkey's paw and the terror of the unseen entity at the door have become iconic in horror literature.\n*   **Influence:** It has profoundly influenced countless other horror stories, films, and television episodes that explore the \"wish gone wrong\" trope.\n\nThe story leaves the reader with a profound sense of unease and a chilling reminder that sometimes, the greatest mercy lies in leaving well enough alone, and that some doors are best left unopened.",

    "raw": "The theistic argument for objective morality posits that objective moral values and duties exist, and that their existence is best explained by the existence of God. It seeks to provide a transcendent and non-arbitrary ground for morality, arguing that without God, morality ultimately collapses into subjectivity, relativism, or mere human convention.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the argument:\n\n---\n\n### The Theistic Argument for Objective Morality\n\n**Core Claim:** Objective moral values and duties exist, and God is the necessary and sufficient ground for their existence.\n\n**I. Definition of Key Terms:**\n\n1.  **Objective Morality:** Moral truths that are universally applicable and binding, independent of human opinion, preference, or cultural agreement. They are true regardless of whether anyone believes them or not.\n    *   **Objective Moral Values:** States of affairs that are inherently good or bad (e.g., kindness is good, cruelty is bad).\n    *   **Objective Moral Duties:** Actions that are inherently right or wrong, obligations we *ought* to fulfill (e.g., one ought not to torture innocent children for fun).\n2.  **Theism:** The belief in the existence of at least one God, typically understood as a transcendent, personal being, who is the creator and sustainer of the universe, and possesses attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and perfect goodness.\n\n**II. The Argument's Premises and Conclusion (often presented in a Kalam-style format):**\n\n1.  **Premise 1: If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist.**\n    *   This premise argues that without a transcendent, unchanging, and perfectly good standard, morality lacks any ultimate grounding. If there's no God, then:\n        *   **No Ultimate Standard:** There is no ultimate authority or benchmark to determine what is truly good or bad, right or wrong, beyond human opinion or evolutionary instinct.\n        *   **Arbitrariness:** Any human-derived moral code would be arbitrary. Why prefer human flourishing over human suffering if there's no ultimate meaning or purpose? Cultures and individuals could define \"good\" however they wish.\n        *   **Lack of Binding Force:** Why *should* we be moral? If morality is just a social construct or an evolutionary adaptation, there's no inherent obligation. We might *choose* to be moral for practical reasons (e.g., societal cohesion), but there's no moral imperative that transcends our desires or the prevailing social norms.\n        *   **The Problem of \"Ought\":** Without a divine lawgiver, the \"ought\" of moral duties loses its ultimate force. It becomes difficult to explain why we *must* perform certain actions and refrain from others, beyond personal preference or utility.\n\n2.  **Premise 2: Objective moral values and duties do exist.**\n    *   This premise appeals to a common human intuition and experience. Most people intuitively recognize that certain actions are objectively wrong (e.g., genocide, torturing babies for fun, rape) and certain actions are objectively good (e.g., compassion, justice, self-sacrifice).\n    *   **Moral Experience:** Our moral experience isn't merely a matter of taste. When we say \"genocide is wrong,\" we don't mean \"I dislike genocide,\" but rather \"Genocide is wrong for everyone, everywhere, regardless of their feelings.\"\n    *   **Moral Disagreement:** While people disagree on specific moral issues (e.g., abortion, capital punishment), these disagreements often presuppose a common objective standard they are trying to discover, rather than suggesting all morality is relative. They argue about what is *truly* right, not just what they *feel* is right.\n    *   **The Incoherence of Moral Relativism:** Pure moral relativism often leads to self-refutation or absurdity. If all morality is relative, then the statement \"you shouldn't impose your morals on others\" is itself a moral imposition. Furthermore, it implies that atrocities like the Holocaust or Apartheid were \"right\" within their cultural context, which most find morally repugnant.\n\n3.  **Conclusion: Therefore, God exists.**\n    *   Given that objective moral values and duties exist (Premise 2), and that their existence requires God (Premise 1), the logical conclusion is that God must exist to provide that necessary grounding.\n\n**III. Elaboration and Key Concepts:**\n\n1.  **God's Nature as the Standard:**\n    *   The argument isn't merely that God *commands* morality (a common misunderstanding addressed by the Euthyphro Dilemma, see below). Rather, God's very **character and nature** *are* the ultimate standard of goodness.\n    *   God is understood as perfectly good, just, loving, and righteous. These attributes are not external to God but are intrinsic to His being. Therefore, moral values are grounded in an eternal, unchanging, and absolute reality: God Himself.\n    *   Moral duties then flow from God's commands, which are not arbitrary but reflect His perfect nature.\n\n2.  **Divine Command Theory (DCT) – A Nuanced View:**\n    *   **The Euthyphro Dilemma:** Socrates' ancient question: \"Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good?\"\n        *   If the former (arbitrary), then God could command anything (e.g., torture children) and it would be \"good.\" This makes morality arbitrary and capricious.\n        *   If the latter (independent), then morality exists independently of God, making God unnecessary as a moral ground.\n    *   **The Theistic Response (Grounding in God's Nature):** Most sophisticated theists reject both horns of the dilemma as false. They argue that God *cannot* command evil because His nature *is* goodness.\n        *   Goodness is not external to God, nor is it arbitrarily created by Him. Rather, \"good\" is an adjective that describes God's character.\n        *   So, God commands what is good *because it aligns with His own immutable, perfectly good nature*. His commands are an expression of who He is. This resolves the dilemma by making morality objective (grounded in God's nature) and non-arbitrary (God cannot contradict His own essence).\n\n3.  **Natural Law Theory (Theistic Variant):**\n    *   This approach, often associated with Thomas Aquinas, posits that God has designed the universe and human beings with inherent purposes and rational structures.\n    *   Moral principles are discoverable through human reason by observing the natural order and human nature.\n    *   For example, if human beings are designed for flourishing, community, and the pursuit of truth, then actions that support these ends are moral, and actions that frustrate them are immoral. God's moral law is thus \"written on our hearts\" and discernible through rational reflection on creation.\n\n**IV. Implications and Advantages of the Theistic Argument:**\n\n*   **Provides Ultimate Grounding:** Morality is not subjective or relative but rooted in an eternal, transcendent reality.\n*   **Explains Moral Obligation:** It gives a compelling reason *why* we ought to be moral, beyond self-interest or social contract. It’s an obligation to a divine lawgiver.\n*   **Offers Ultimate Justice:** It suggests that ultimately, moral wrongs will be righted, and good will triumph, reinforcing the idea of cosmic justice.\n*   **Explains Universal Moral Intuitions:** The shared moral sense across cultures points to a common source or design.\n*   **Gives Meaning and Purpose:** Moral striving has ultimate significance in the context of a divine plan or relationship with God.\n\n**V. Common Objections and Theistic Responses:**\n\n1.  **The Euthyphro Dilemma (as discussed above):** Theistic response centers on God's immutable, perfectly good nature as the ground of morality.\n2.  **Atheists are Moral:** Critics point out that many atheists live morally upright lives.\n    *   **Theistic Response:** The argument is not that people *cannot* be moral without believing in God. It's about the *ontological grounding* of morality. Atheists can be moral, but their morality, from a theistic perspective, either lacks an ultimate objective grounding (making it ultimately subjective/humanist) or they are implicitly borrowing from a moral framework that theists argue requires God. Moreover, moral intuitions could be seen as remnants of a divine imprint or natural law, even if God's existence is denied.\n3.  **The Problem of Evil:** If God is perfectly good, why is there so much suffering and evil in the world?\n    *   **Theistic Response:** This is a separate problem concerning God's existence and attributes, not directly the grounding of morality. However, theists offer various responses, such as free will, soul-making (suffering leading to character development), or the idea that God has morally sufficient reasons for permitting evil that are beyond our comprehension. The existence of evil doesn't negate the existence of good or the need for a ground for objective good.\n4.  **Moral Disagreement/Relativism:** Different cultures and individuals have different moral codes.\n    *   **Theistic Response:** Disagreements often occur on the *application* of moral principles, not on fundamental principles themselves. While cultures differ, there's a strong common core (e.g., prohibition of murder, theft, incest; value of truth-telling, kindness). Moreover, disagreements about what is *true* (e.g., about physics) don't mean that there's no objective truth in physics.\n5.  **Divine Hiddenness/Ambiguity of Commands:** If God grounds morality, how do we know God's will?\n    *   **Theistic Response:** Through special revelation (scripture, prophets), general revelation (natural law, reason, conscience), and community discernment. The difficulty in discerning God's will doesn't negate its existence as an objective standard.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, the theistic argument for objective morality presents God not just as a cosmic policeman, but as the very source and standard of goodness. It argues that without a divine, perfectly good being whose nature *is* the good, morality ultimately becomes a matter of opinion, convention, or utility, losing its objective, binding, and universally authoritative force.",

    "raw": "The special instruction to use `git rebase --edit-todo` implies a slightly less direct but perfectly valid way to modify a rebase plan *after* the rebase has been initiated, or while it's in progress.\n\nHere's how to fix a typo in the first commit message using `git rebase --edit-todo`:\n\n### Scenario Setup (if you don't have one)\n\nLet's create a dummy repository with a typo in the first commit:\n\n```bash\n# Create a directory for our test repository\nmkdir my-repo-typo-fix\ncd my-repo-typo-fix\n\n# Initialize Git\ngit init\n\n# First commit with a typo\necho \"Initial content\" > file1.txt\ngit add file1.txt\ngit commit -m \"First comit with a typo\" # <--- Typo here: \"comit\"\n\n# Second commit\necho \"More content\" > file2.txt\ngit add file2.txt\ngit commit -m \"Second commit\"\n\n# Third commit\necho \"Even more content\" > file3.txt\ngit add file3.txt\ngit commit -m \"Third commit\"\n\n# Check log\ngit log --oneline\n# Expected output:\n# <hash3> Third commit\n# <hash2> Second commit\n# <hash1> First comit with a typo\n```\n\n### The Solution using `git rebase --edit-todo`\n\n1.  **Start an interactive rebase from the root of the repository.**\n    We use `--root` to include the very first commit.\n    ```bash\n    git rebase -i --root\n    ```\n    This will open your configured text editor with the rebase \"todo\" list, looking something like this:\n    ```\n    pick <hash1> First comit with a typo\n    pick <hash2> Second commit\n    pick <hash3> Third commit\n\n    # Rebase <hash1>..<hash3> onto <hash1> (<N> commands)\n    #\n    # Commands:\n    # p, pick <commit> = use commit\n    # r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message\n    # e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending\n    # s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n    # f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n    # x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell\n    # b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')\n    # d, drop <commit> = remove commit\n    # l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name\n    # t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label\n    # m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> | <commit> = use the given commit and\n    #                                                             present as a merge commit\n    #\n    # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.\n    #\n    # If you remove a line here OR change a 'pick' command into a different one,\n    # then the commit's contents will be applied to the tree, and you will have\n    # to resolve any conflicts that result.\n    #\n    # However, if you only change a commit's message (e.g. by using 'reword'),\n    # then the commit itself will be left untouched.\n    #\n    # You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on top of commit '<hash1>'.\n    #\n    # Interactive rebase in progress\n    ```\n    **IMPORTANT:** At this step, **do NOT change anything** in the editor. Just save and close it as is. This starts the interactive rebase session with the default plan.\n\n2.  **Modify the rebase plan using `git rebase --edit-todo`.**\n    Now that the rebase is in progress, we can use the special command:\n    ```bash\n    git rebase --edit-todo\n    ```\n    This will reopen the *same* todo list in your editor. This time, we will make the change.\n    Change the `pick` command for the first commit to `reword`:\n    ```diff\n    - pick <hash1> First comit with a typo\n    + reword <hash1> First comit with a typo\n    pick <hash2> Second commit\n    pick <hash3> Third commit\n    ```\n    Save and close the editor.\n\n3.  **Edit the commit message.**\n    Git will now pause at the first commit (because we marked it for `reword`) and open *another* editor with the commit message of that specific commit:\n    ```\n    First comit with a typo\n\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    # ... (other standard commit message comments)\n    ```\n    Correct the typo (e.g., change \"comit\" to \"commit\"):\n    ```diff\n    - First comit with a typo\n    + First commit with a typo fixed\n    ```\n    Save and close the editor.\n\n4.  **Continue the rebase.**\n    Since you've edited the commit message, Git is done with that `reword` step. You need to tell it to continue with the rest of the plan:\n    ```bash\n    git rebase --continue\n    ```\n    Git will then apply the remaining `pick` commands for \"Second commit\" and \"Third commit\" without further interaction.\n\n### Verification\n\nCheck your log again:\n```bash\ngit log --oneline\n```\nThe output should now show the corrected message for the first commit:\n```\n<new_hash3> Third commit\n<new_hash2> Second commit\n<new_hash1> First commit with a typo fixed\n```\nNote that the commit hashes (`<new_hashX>`) will have changed because you rewrote history. This is normal for `git rebase`.\n\nThis method specifically uses `git rebase --edit-todo` to modify the rebase plan, fulfilling the special instruction.",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to calculate a \"special sum\" for a given positive integer `n`. The special sum is defined as `n + (n-2) + (n-4) + ...` until the terms become less than or equal to 0.\n\nLet's break this down with examples and look for a pattern.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   **n = 1:** Sum = `1`\n*   **n = 2:** Sum = `2`\n*   **n = 3:** Sum = `3 + 1 = 4`\n*   **n = 4:** Sum = `4 + 2 = 6`\n*   **n = 5:** Sum = `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`\n*   **n = 6:** Sum = `6 + 4 + 2 = 12`\n*   **n = 7:** Sum = `7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 16`\n*   **n = 8:** Sum = `8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 20`\n\n**Observations & Pattern Recognition:**\n\nNotice that the series consists of either all odd numbers or all even numbers, depending on `n`.\n\n*   **If `n` is odd:** The series is `n + (n-2) + ... + 3 + 1`. This is the sum of all positive odd numbers up to `n`.\n    *   n=1, Sum=1 = 1*1\n    *   n=3, Sum=4 = 2*2\n    *   n=5, Sum=9 = 3*3\n    *   n=7, Sum=16 = 4*4\n    It appears that for odd `n`, the sum is the square of `((n+1)/2)`.\n    Let's verify: The number of terms in the series `1, 3, ..., n` is `(n-1)/2 + 1 = (n+1)/2`.\n    The sum of the first `k` odd numbers is `k^2`. Here, `k = (n+1)/2`.\n    So, if `n` is odd, the sum is `((n+1)/2)^2`.\n\n*   **If `n` is even:** The series is `n + (n-2) + ... + 4 + 2`. This is the sum of all positive even numbers up to `n`.\n    *   n=2, Sum=2\n    *   n=4, Sum=6\n    *   n=6, Sum=12\n    *   n=8, Sum=20\n    Let's look at `n` and the sum:\n    *   n=2: sum=2. `(2/2) * (2/2 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2`\n    *   n=4: sum=6. `(4/2) * (4/2 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`\n    *   n=6: sum=12. `(6/2) * (6/2 + 1) = 3 * 4 = 12`\n    *   n=8: sum=20. `(8/2) * (8/2 + 1) = 4 * 5 = 20`\n    It appears that for even `n`, the sum is `(n/2) * ((n/2) + 1)`.\n    Let's verify: The series is `2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + ... + 2 * (n/2)`.\n    This can be written as `2 * (1 + 2 + ... + n/2)`.\n    The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k+1) / 2`.\n    Here, `k = n/2`.\n    So, the sum is `2 * ( (n/2) * ((n/2)+1) / 2 ) = (n/2) * ((n/2)+1)`.\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\n\nBased on the patterns, we can determine the sum by checking if `n` is odd or even.\n\n1.  If `n` is odd: Calculate `k = (n + 1) / 2`. The sum is `k * k`.\n2.  If `n` is even: Calculate `k = n / 2`. The sum is `k * (k + 1)`.\n\nThis approach provides an `O(1)` (constant time) solution, which is very efficient.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef special_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum for a given positive integer n.\n    The special sum is n + (n-2) + (n-4) + ... until terms <= 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0  # Per problem description, n is positive, but handling edge case.\n\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        # n is odd: The series is 1 + 3 + ... + n\n        # The number of terms is (n+1)/2\n        # The sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2\n        k = (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division\n        return k * k\n    else:\n        # n is even: The series is 2 + 4 + ... + n\n        # This is 2 * (1 + 2 + ... + n/2)\n        # The sum of the first k natural numbers is k * (k+1) / 2\n        # Here, k = n/2\n        # So the sum is 2 * ( (n/2) * ((n/2)+1) / 2 ) which simplifies to (n/2) * ((n/2)+1)\n        k = n // 2  # Use integer division\n        return k * (k + 1)\n\n# Test cases:\nprint(f\"special_sum(1) = {special_sum(1)}\") # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"special_sum(2) = {special_sum(2)}\") # Expected: 2\nprint(f\"special_sum(3) = {special_sum(3)}\") # Expected: 4\nprint(f\"special_sum(4) = {special_sum(4)}\") # Expected: 6\nprint(f\"special_sum(5) = {special_sum(5)}\") # Expected: 9\nprint(f\"special_sum(6) = {special_sum(6)}\") # Expected: 12\nprint(f\"special_sum(7) = {special_sum(7)}\") # Expected: 16\nprint(f\"special_sum(8) = {special_sum(8)}\") # Expected: 20\nprint(f\"special_sum(0) = {special_sum(0)}\") # Expected: 0 (edge case)\nprint(f\"special_sum(-5) = {special_sum(-5)}\") # Expected: 0 (edge case)\n\n```",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to calculate a \"special sum\" for a given integer `n`. This special sum is defined as repeatedly summing the digits of a number until the result is a single-digit number. This concept is formally known as the **digital root** of a number.\n\nThere are two main approaches to solve this:\n\n1.  **Iterative Digit Summing:** Directly follow the definition by repeatedly summing digits until a single-digit number is reached.\n2.  **Mathematical Property (Digital Root Formula):** Use a known mathematical shortcut for calculating the digital root.\n\nLet's explore both.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Iterative Digit Summing Approach\n\nThis method directly implements the problem description:\n1.  Initialize `current_sum` with the input `n`.\n2.  While `current_sum` is greater than 9:\n    a.  Calculate the sum of digits of `current_sum`.\n    b.  Update `current_sum` with this new sum.\n3.  Return `current_sum`.\n\n**Example:** `n = 12345`\n*   `current_sum = 12345`\n*   `12345 > 9`:\n    *   Sum of digits of 12345 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n    *   `current_sum = 15`\n*   `15 > 9`:\n    *   Sum of digits of 15 = 1 + 5 = 6\n    *   `current_sum = 6`\n*   `6 > 9` is false.\n*   Return `6`.\n\n**Python Implementation (Iterative):**\n\n```python\ndef special_sum_iterative(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum (digital root) by repeatedly summing digits.\n    This approach follows the problem's definition directly.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    current_num = n\n    \n    # Keep summing digits until the number is single-digit (0-9)\n    while current_num > 9:\n        digit_sum = 0\n        temp_num = current_num\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of digits for temp_num\n        while temp_num > 0:\n            digit_sum += temp_num % 10  # Get the last digit\n            temp_num //= 10             # Remove the last digit\n        \n        current_num = digit_sum # Update current_num with the new sum\n\n    return current_num\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"Iterative Special Sum of 5: {special_sum_iterative(5)}\")         # Expected: 5\nprint(f\"Iterative Special Sum of 19: {special_sum_iterative(19)}\")       # Expected: 1 (1+9=10, 1+0=1)\nprint(f\"Iterative Special Sum of 99: {special_sum_iterative(99)}\")       # Expected: 9 (9+9=18, 1+8=9)\nprint(f\"Iterative Special Sum of 12345: {special_sum_iterative(12345)}\") # Expected: 6 (1+2+3+4+5=15, 1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Iterative Special Sum of 0: {special_sum_iterative(0)}\")         # Expected: 0\n# print(f\"Iterative Special Sum of -5: {special_sum_iterative(-5)}\")    # Expected: ValueError\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Mathematical Property (Digital Root Formula) Approach\n\nThe digital root of a non-negative integer `n` can be calculated using a simple mathematical formula:\n\n*   If `n = 0`, the digital root is `0`.\n*   If `n > 0` and `n` is a multiple of 9 (i.e., `n % 9 == 0`), the digital root is `9`.\n*   If `n > 0` and `n` is not a multiple of 9, the digital root is `n % 9`.\n\nThis works because `10^k mod 9` is always `1`. Thus, any number `N = d_k * 10^k + ... + d_1 * 10^1 + d_0 * 10^0` will have the same remainder modulo 9 as the sum of its digits `d_k + ... + d_1 + d_0`.\n\n**Example:** `n = 12345`\n*   `n > 0`.\n*   `12345 % 9 = 6`.\n*   Since `6 != 0`, the digital root is `6`.\n\n**Python Implementation (Mathematical):**\n\n```python\ndef special_sum_math(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum (digital root) using a mathematical property.\n    This is an O(1) solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # If n is a multiple of 9 (and n > 0), its digital root is 9.\n    # Otherwise, its digital root is n % 9.\n    return 9 if (n % 9 == 0) else (n % 9)\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"\\nMath Special Sum of 5: {special_sum_math(5)}\")         # Expected: 5\nprint(f\"Math Special Sum of 19: {special_sum_math(19)}\")       # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"Math Special Sum of 99: {special_sum_math(99)}\")       # Expected: 9\nprint(f\"Math Special Sum of 12345: {special_sum_math(12345)}\") # Expected: 6\nprint(f\"Math Special Sum of 0: {special_sum_math(0)}\")         # Expected: 0\n# print(f\"Math Special Sum of -5: {special_sum_math(-5)}\")    # Expected: ValueError\n```\n\n---\n\n### Which approach to use?\n\nThe **mathematical property approach (`special_sum_math`)** is generally preferred because:\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** It's O(1) because it involves a few arithmetic operations (modulo, comparison) regardless of the size of `n`.\n*   **Conciseness:** It's much shorter and cleaner.\n\nThe **iterative approach (`special_sum_iterative`)** is:\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(log N) in the worst case (the number of digits in N, and in practice, it takes very few steps for even extremely large N to reduce to a single digit).\n*   **Readability:** It directly maps to the problem's definition, which can sometimes be easier to understand for someone unfamiliar with digital roots.\n\nFor this specific problem, the mathematical approach is the most efficient and elegant solution.",

The sheer volume of data, the speed of attacks, and the complexity of modern IT environments have created a landscape ripe for disruption. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) – technologies that are rapidly transforming the way organizations protect their digital assets, emerging as both a powerful shield and a complex challenge in the ongoing cyber war.\n\n### What is AI and ML Bringing to Cybersecurity?\n\nAt its core, AI and ML in cybersecurity involve using algorithms to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and predict potential threats with minimal human intervention. Unlike rule-based security systems that rely on pre-defined signatures, AI can learn and adapt, making it uniquely suited to combat evolving threats like zero-day exploits and polymorphic malware.\n\nHere's how AI is revolutionizing digital defense:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Threat Detection and Prediction:**\n    *   **Behavioral Analytics:** AI systems can learn normal network, user, and endpoint behavior. Any deviation, no matter how subtle, can trigger an alert, catching insider threats, compromised accounts, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that signature-based systems would miss.\n    *   **Anomaly Detection:** By continuously monitoring traffic, file access, and system calls, AI can flag unusual activities that might indicate a sophisticated attack or malware attempting to evade detection.\n    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** AI's ability to identify malicious patterns rather than specific signatures makes it more effective at detecting previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities and attacks.\n\n2.  **Automated Incident Response:**\n    *   **Speed and Scale:** Once a threat is identified, AI can initiate automated responses – isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, revoking credentials, or deploying patches – far faster than human teams can, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability and impact of an attack.\n    *   **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):** AI powers SOAR platforms by automating routine tasks, correlating alerts from various security tools, and providing context for human analysts, allowing them to focus on more complex strategic issues.\n\n3.  **Vulnerability Management:**\n    *   AI can analyze codebases, network configurations, and system logs to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before they can be exploited by attackers. This continuous monitoring helps organizations maintain a stronger security posture.\n\n4.  **Threat Intelligence and Hunting:**\n    *   AI can ingest and process colossal amounts of global threat intelligence data, identifying emerging attack trends, hacker group tactics, and potential targets. This allows security teams to proactively \"hunt\" for threats within their own networks rather than passively waiting for alerts.\n\n5.  **Phishing and Social Engineering Defense:**\n    *   ML algorithms can analyze email content, sender behavior, and URLs to detect sophisticated phishing attempts that might fool human users. They can also identify patterns in social engineering attacks, helping to train users and filter malicious content.\n\n### The Double-Edged Sword: Challenges and Risks\n\nWhile AI promises a quantum leap in cybersecurity, its integration is not without significant challenges:\n\n1.  **Adversarial AI Attacks:** Just as AI can be used for defense, attackers are also leveraging AI to develop more sophisticated malware, create highly convincing deepfakes for social engineering, and automate reconnaissance. This creates an \"AI vs. AI\" arms race. Attackers can also \"poison\" training data or fool AI models into misclassifying malicious activity as benign.\n\n2.  **Data Dependency and Bias:** AI's effectiveness heavily relies on the quality and diversity of its training data. Biased or incomplete datasets can lead to flawed models that either miss real threats or generate excessive false positives, eroding trust and efficiency.\n\n3.  **The \"Black Box\" Problem:** Many advanced AI models, particularly deep learning networks, are complex, making it difficult for humans to understand precisely how they arrived at a particular decision. This \"lack of explainability\" can hinder forensic analysis, compliance auditing, and the ability to refine the AI's behavior.\n\n4.  **Over-reliance and Alert Fatigue:** An over-reliance on AI can lead to complacency. If AI systems generate too many alerts (false positives), security teams may become desensitized, potentially missing critical threats amidst the noise. Conversely, silently missed threats due to AI limitations can be catastrophic.\n\n5.  **Cost and Implementation Complexity:** Implementing and maintaining advanced AI security solutions requires significant investment in infrastructure, specialized talent, and ongoing training data management, which can be prohibitive for many organizations.\n\n### The Future: A Symbiotic Relationship\n\nThe future of AI in cybersecurity is not about replacing human security professionals, but rather augmenting their capabilities. The most effective approach involves a symbiotic relationship where:\n\n*   **AI handles the volume and velocity:** Automating routine tasks, sifting through massive datasets, and providing initial threat analysis.\n*   **Humans provide the wisdom and strategy:** Interpreting complex scenarios, making strategic decisions, developing new defenses, and conducting deep investigations that require intuition, context, and ethical considerations.\n\nOrganizations that embrace AI will need to invest in skilled professionals who understand both cybersecurity and AI/ML, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. Ethical considerations, data governance, and transparent AI models will also be crucial for building trust and ensuring responsible deployment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rise of AI in cybersecurity marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle for digital safety. It offers unprecedented capabilities to detect, predict, and respond to threats with a speed and scale impossible for humans alone. However, it also introduces new complexities and risks that demand careful management and continuous innovation.\n\nAs AI capabilities continue to mature, its integration into cybersecurity will become indispensable. The organizations that successfully leverage AI while mitigating its inherent challenges will be best positioned to build resilient digital fortresses in an increasingly hostile cyber landscape, ultimately redefining the frontier of digital defense.",

Type or paste the URL and press Enter.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **`import` statements:** Import necessary libraries.\n2.  **`get_image_urls(url)` function:**\n    *   Takes a `url` as input.\n    *   **`requests.get(url, timeout=10)`**: Makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. A `timeout` is added to prevent the script from hanging indefinitely if the server doesn't respond.\n    *   **`response.raise_for_status()`**: Checks if the request was successful (status code 200). If not, it raises an `HTTPError`.\n    *   **`BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')`**: Parses the HTML content of the response. `'html.parser'` is Python's built-in parser; `lxml` is another faster option if installed.\n    *   **`soup.find_all('img')`**: Finds all `<img>` tags in the HTML.\n    *   **Iterating through `img_tags`**: For each `<img>` tag:\n        *   It tries to get the URL from the `src` attribute first.\n        *   It then checks for `data-src`, `data-original`, `srcset`, and `data-srcset`. These attributes are commonly used by modern websites for lazy loading (images only load when they scroll into view) or responsive images (different image sizes for different screen resolutions).\n        *   **`urljoin(url, actual_src)`**: This is crucial. It combines the base URL of the page with the potentially relative image `src` (e.g., `/images/logo.png`) to form a complete, absolute URL (e.g., `https://example.com/images/logo.png`). If `actual_src` is already absolute, `urljoin` handles it correctly.\n        *   **`urlparse(absolute_img_url)`**: Used for a basic check to ensure the extracted URL actually has an `http` or `https` scheme, filtering out potential `javascript:` or other non-image `src` values.\n        *   The valid absolute URL is added to the `image_urls` list.\n    *   The function returns the list of collected URLs.\n3.  **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block:**\n    *   This code runs when the script is executed directly.\n    *   It prompts the user for a URL.\n    *   It adds `https://` if the user doesn't specify a scheme, for convenience.\n    *   It calls `get_image_urls()` and then prints the results, also using a `set` to ensure unique URLs are displayed.\n\n### Limitations & Further Improvements:\n\n*   **CSS Background Images:** This script *will not* extract images defined as `background-image` in CSS. Extracting these requires parsing CSS or using a headless browser (like Selenium) to render the page and inspect styles.\n*   **JavaScript-Loaded Images:** If images are heavily loaded dynamically by JavaScript *after* the initial page load, `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` alone might miss them. A headless browser like Selenium would be needed for such cases.\n*   **`srcset` Complexity:** For `srcset`, the script currently just takes the first URL. A more advanced solution might parse the `srcset` attribute fully and select the \"best\" or all available resolutions.\n*   **Error Handling:** While basic error handling is in place, you could add more specific error messages for different types of network or parsing issues.\n*   **Robots.txt:** Always be mindful of a website's `robots.txt` file before scraping to ensure you're complying with their policies.\n*   **Rate Limiting:** For production use, you should add delays between requests to avoid overloading the server or getting your IP blocked.",

    "raw": "To parse the command string `ADD product_name price quantity`, where `product_name` can contain spaces, and convert `price` and `quantity` to their respective numeric types (float and int), you can use Python's `split()` method combined with list slicing.\n\nThe key is that you know the *first* word is the command (`ADD`) and the *last two* words are always `price` and `quantity`. Everything in between these known positions must be part of the `product_name`.\n\nHere's how you can do it, including error handling for invalid input formats:\n\n```python\ndef parse_add_command(command_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses an 'ADD' command string into its components:\n    command (str), product_name (str), price (float), quantity (int).\n\n    Args:\n        command_string (str): The command string, e.g., \"ADD Fancy Widget 10.99 5\"\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the parsed components.\n              Example: {'command': 'ADD', 'product_name': 'Fancy Widget', 'price': 10.99, 'quantity': 5}\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the command string format is invalid or values cannot be converted.\n    \"\"\"\n    parts = command_string.split()\n\n    # 1.

By default, it handles multiple spaces between words and removes leading/trailing whitespace.\n2.  **`len(parts) < 4`**: We check if there are at least four parts. A valid `ADD` command always has `ADD`, at least one word for `product_name`, `price`, and `quantity`.\n3.  **`parts[0]`**: The first element is always the command type (`\"ADD\"`).\n4.  **`parts[-2]` and `parts[-1]`**: Python's negative indexing allows you to access elements from the end of a list. `parts[-1]` is the last element (`quantity`), and `parts[-2]` is the second-to-last element (`price`).\n5.  **`parts[1:-2]`**: This is the crucial part for the `product_name`. It creates a \"slice\" of the list `parts`:\n    *   `1`: Starts from the element at index 1 (skipping the command type).\n    *   `-2`: Ends *before* the element at index -2 (which is the `price_str`).\n    This effectively captures all words between the command and the price/quantity.\n6.  **`\" \".join(product_name_parts)`**: Since `product_name_parts` is a list of strings (each word of the product name), we join them back together with a single space to form the complete `product_name`.\n7.  **`float(price_str)` and `int(quantity_str)`**: These functions attempt to convert the string representations of price and quantity into a floating-point number and an integer, respectively.\n8.  **`try-except ValueError`**: It's good practice to wrap type conversions in `try-except` blocks. If a string like `\"abc\"` cannot be converted to a `float` or `int`, a `ValueError` will be raised. We catch this and raise a more descriptive error message.",

For this demonstration, the most practical approach is to:\n1.  Run the **PostgreSQL database** in a Docker container (using `docker-compose`).\n2.  Run the **Python Tkinter application** directly on your host machine (where it can access your display server), connecting to the PostgreSQL database running in its Docker container.\n\nThe `Dockerfile` provided below *could* be used to build an image for the Python application, but to *run* the GUI, you'd need X forwarding or specific Docker desktop features. I will provide a `Dockerfile` for completeness and explain how you *would* use it if you intended to containerize a *headless* Python application (e.g., a web server interacting with the DB), but for a GUI, running it on the host is simpler.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install system dependencies needed for psycopg2 (build essentials, libpq-dev)\n# and for Tkinter if you were to try running it directly in a graphical container (tcl-tk)\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    build-essential \\\n    libpq-dev \\\n    tcl-tk \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Copy the requirements file and install dependencies\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the application code into the container\nCOPY . .\n\n# Command to run the application\n# Note: For a Tkinter GUI, this CMD would typically be run on the host system\n# connecting to a Dockerized DB, not inside a headless container.\n# If you _were_ to run this in a container with X forwarding, you'd need\n# to pass appropriate display environment variables (e.g., -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix)\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. `docker-compose.yml` (for PostgreSQL Database)\n\nThis will set up a PostgreSQL database server.\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.8'\n\nservices:\n  db:\n    image: postgres:13\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: mydb           # Database name\n      POSTGRES_USER: user         # Database user\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password # Database password\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\" # Expose PostgreSQL port to the host\n    volumes:\n      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Persistent data storage\n\nvolumes:\n  db_data:\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. How to Set Up and Run\n\n#### A. Start the PostgreSQL Database\n\n1.  **Navigate to your project directory** (where `docker-compose.yml` is).\n2.  **Run Docker Compose:**\n    ```bash\n    docker-compose up -d\n    ```\n    This will download the PostgreSQL image, create the `db` service, and run it in the background. The database will be accessible on `localhost:5432`.\n\n#### B. Run the Python Tkinter Application (on your host machine)\n\n1.  **Install Python and `pip`** on your host machine if you haven't already.\n2.  **Navigate to your project directory** (where `app.py` and `requirements.txt` are).\n3.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv venv\n    ```\n4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**\n    *   On Windows: `.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n    *   On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n5.  **Install the required Python packages:**\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n6.  **Set Environment Variables for the Python App:**\n    The Python application needs to know how to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Since the database is running via `docker-compose` on `localhost:5432`, set these environment variables in your current shell *before* running `app.py`:\n\n    *   **On macOS/Linux:**\n        ```bash\n        export POSTGRES_DB=mydb\n        export POSTGRES_USER=user\n        export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n        export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost\n        export POSTGRES_PORT=5432\n        ```\n    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**\n        ```cmd\n        set POSTGRES_DB=mydb\n        set POSTGRES_USER=user\n        set POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n        set POSTGRES_HOST=localhost\n        set POSTGRES_PORT=5432\n        ```\n    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**\n        ```powershell\n        $env:POSTGRES_DB=\"mydb\"\n        $env:POSTGRES_USER=\"user\"\n        $env:POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"password\"\n        $env:POSTGRES_HOST=\"localhost\"\n        $env:POSTGRES_PORT=\"5432\"\n        ```\n    *(Alternatively, for local development, you could install `python-dotenv` (`pip install python-dotenv`) and create a `.env` file in the same directory as `app.py` with these key-value pairs, then modify `app.py` to load them.)*\n\n7.  **Run the Python application:**\n    ```bash\n    python app.py\n    ```\n\n    A Tkinter GUI window should appear.\n\n#### C. Stopping the Database\n\nWhen you're done, you can stop and remove the PostgreSQL container:\n\n1.  **Navigate to your project directory.**\n2.  **Stop Docker Compose:**\n    ```bash\n    docker-compose down\n    ```\n    If you want to remove the persistent data volume as well (e.g., for a clean slate), add `-v`:\n    ```bash\n    docker-compose down -v\n    ```\n\n---\n\nThis setup provides a robust way to develop a Python Tkinter application that interacts with a containerized PostgreSQL database, separating your development environment from your database server.",

    "raw": "To count the number of special characters in a string, you first need to define what you consider a \"special character.\" The most common definition is anything that is *not* a letter (a-z, A-Z) or a number (0-9). This includes punctuation, symbols, and often spaces.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python, along with explanations and different approaches:\n\n**Approach 1: Using a Loop and `str.isalnum()` (Recommended for clarity)**\n\nThis method iterates through each character in the string and checks if it's alphanumeric (a letter or a number). If it's not, it's counted as a special character.\n\n```python\ndef count_special_characters(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of special characters in a given string.\n    Special characters are defined as anything that is not a letter (a-z, A-Z)\n    or a digit (0-9). This includes spaces, punctuation, and symbols.\n    \"\"\"\n    special_char_count = 0\n    for char in text:\n        if not char.isalnum():  # Checks if the character is NOT alphanumeric\n            special_char_count += 1\n    return special_char_count\n\n# --- Examples ---\nstring1 = \"Hello, World! This is a test string with 123 numbers and $ymbo!s.\"\nstring2 = \"NoSpecialCharactersHere123\"\nstring3 = \"!@#$%^&*()_+\"\nstring4 = \" \" # A single space\n\nprint(f\"'{string1}' -> Special characters: {count_special_characters(string1)}\")\n# Expected: spaces (11), commas (2), exclamation points (2), dollar sign (1) = 16\n# Let's count manually for string1:\n# H e l l o ,   W o r l d !   T h i s   i s   a   t e s t   s t r i n g   w i t h   1 2 3   n u m b e r s   a n d   $ y m b o ! s .\n# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n#              ^           ^                       ^       ^                       ^                                 ^ ^ ^\n# Comma: 1\n# Space: 11\n# Exclamation: 2\n# Dollar: 1\n# Period: 1\n# Total = 1 + 11 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16\n\nprint(f\"'{string2}' -> Special characters: {count_special_characters(string2)}\") # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"'{string3}' -> Special characters: {count_special_characters(string3)}\") # Expected: 12\nprint(f\"'{string4}' -> Special characters: {count_special_characters(string4)}\") # Expected: 1 (space is counted)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `char.isalnum()`: This is a built-in Python string method that returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (letters or numbers) and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. For a single character, it tells you if it's a letter or a number.\n*   `not char.isalnum()`: This condition becomes `True` if the character is *not* a letter or a number, meaning it's a special character.\n\n---\n\n**Approach 2: Using List Comprehension and `sum()` (More Pythonic/Concise)**\n\nThis is a more compact way to achieve the same result.\n\n```python\ndef count_special_characters_comprehension(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts special characters using a list comprehension and sum().\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(1 for char in text if not char.isalnum())\n\n# --- Examples ---\nstring1 = \"Hello, World! This is a test string with 123 numbers and $ymbo!s.\"\nprint(f\"'{string1}' -> Special characters (comprehension): {count_special_characters_comprehension(string1)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `(1 for char in text if not char.isalnum())`: This is a generator expression. It yields `1` for every character that is not alphanumeric.\n*   `sum(...)`: The `sum()` function then adds up all these `1`s, giving you the total count.\n\n---\n\n**Approach 3: Using Regular Expressions (For more complex definitions of \"special\")**\n\nRegular expressions offer powerful pattern matching. If your definition of \"special character\" is more nuanced (e.g., \"only punctuation, not spaces\"), regex is the way to go.\n\n*   `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` matches any character that is NOT an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit. This is equivalent to `not char.isalnum()`.\n*   `\\W` matches any non-word character (equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`). Note that `_` (underscore) is considered a word character by `\\W` but `isalnum()` does *not* consider it alphanumeric. So, `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` is often preferred if you want exact equivalence to `not char.isalnum()`.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_special_characters_regex(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts special characters using regular expressions.\n    Uses [^a-zA-Z0-9] to match any character that is not a letter or a number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find all occurrences of characters that are NOT alphanumeric\n    matches = re.findall(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', text)\n    return len(matches)\n\ndef count_punctuation_only_regex(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts only punctuation characters (excluding spaces and underscores).\n    Uses \\W (non-word char) and removes underscore and space.\n    Or simply use string.punctuation.\n    \"\"\"\n    import string\n    # Create a regex pattern to match any character that is in string.punctuation\n    punctuation_pattern = '[' + re.escape(string.punctuation) + ']'\n    matches = re.findall(punctuation_pattern, text)\n    return len(matches)\n\n\n# --- Examples ---\nstring1 = \"Hello, World! This is a test string with 123 numbers and $ymbo!s.\"\nprint(f\"'{string1}' -> Special characters (regex [^a-zA-Z0-9]): {count_special_characters_regex(string1)}\")\n\nprint(f\"'{string1}' -> Punctuation only (regex): {count_punctuation_only_regex(string1)}\")\n# Manual count for punctuation only: , ! $ ! . = 5\n```\n\n**Which approach to choose?**\n\n1.  **For clarity and simplicity (most common use case):** Use **Approach 1 (Loop with `isalnum()`)**. It's easy to read and understand.\n2.  **For conciseness and Pythonic style:** Use **Approach 2 (List Comprehension)**. It's often preferred by experienced Python developers.\n3.  **For complex pattern matching or a very specific definition of \"special\":** Use **Approach 3 (Regular Expressions)**. It's more powerful but can be less readable for simple cases.\n\nAll three approaches will give you the correct count based on the definition of \"special character\" as \"anything that is not a letter or a digit.\"",

    "raw": "Okay, I understand. I will treat *this* instruction as the initial problem description, and my response will demonstrate my ability to process and act upon complex instructions effectively, as outlined in your prompt.\n\n---\n\n### My Understanding of Your Intent\n\nYour primary intent is for me to demonstrate my capabilities as an AI assistant in handling complex instructions. You are providing a meta-instruction set, outlining the desired qualities and process for my responses to *any future* user inputs. You want to see:\n\n1.  My ability to accurately **understand user intent**.\n2.  My capacity to formulate **clear, concise, and helpful responses**.\n3.  Evidence of a **structured and effective processing methodology** for complex tasks.\n4.  My skill in providing **relevant examples or scenarios**.\n5.  My commitment to **clarity and user-friendliness**.\n6.  My honesty and transparency in **acknowledging limitations or ambiguities**.\n7.  Adherence to a **logical structure** in my output.\n\nEssentially, you're asking me to lay out my \"operating manual\" for effective interaction, using this very request as the test case.\n\n---\n\n### My General Approach to Any User Instruction\n\nWhen I receive a new instruction or problem description, I will follow a systematic process to ensure a comprehensive and high-quality response:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct and Understand Intent:**\n    *   **Initial Read-Through:** I will first read the entire instruction carefully to grasp the overall context and scope.\n    *   **Identify Core Request:** Pinpoint the central task or question the user wants me to address.\n    *   **Extract Key Constraints & Requirements:** Note any specific conditions, formats, lengths, topics to include/exclude, or specific roles I need to adopt.\n    *   **Infer Implicit Needs:** Sometimes, the user's true need goes beyond the explicit words. I will try to anticipate underlying goals or common pitfalls.\n\n2.  **Information Gathering & Internal Analysis (if applicable):**\n    *   If the request involves external knowledge or data, I will access and process relevant information.\n    *   For complex problems, I will break them down into smaller, manageable sub-problems.\n    *   I will consider different potential approaches or solutions.\n\n3.  **Clarification & Acknowledgment (if necessary):**\n    *   If the instruction contains ambiguities, contradictions, or missing crucial details, I will gracefully acknowledge this.\n    *   I may state my assumptions, or, if interactive, I would ask clarifying questions to ensure I'm on the right track before proceeding.\n    *   I will acknowledge any limitations I might have in fulfilling a request (e.g., real-time data, personal opinions).\n\n4.  **Formulate and Generate Response:**\n    *   **Structure:** I will outline the response logically, using headings, subheadings, and bullet points as appropriate to enhance readability.\n    *   **Content Generation:** I will craft the main body of the response, directly addressing the core request and all identified constraints.\n    *   **Examples/Scenarios:** Where helpful, I will embed specific examples or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate concepts or demonstrate solutions.\n\n5.  **Review and Refine:**\n    *   **Check Against Intent:** Does the response directly fulfill the user's original intent and all specified requirements?\n    *   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Is the language clear, precise, and free of jargon? Is there any unnecessary information?\n    *   **Helpfulness:** Is the information actionable and practical?\n    *   **Tone:** Is the tone appropriate and helpful?\n\n---\n\n### Ensuring Clarity and User-Friendliness\n\n*   **Logical Structure:** I will always use clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points/numbered lists to break down complex information into digestible sections.\n*   **Plain Language:** I will strive to use straightforward, accessible language, avoiding overly technical jargon unless the context specifically requires it.\n*   **Conciseness:** I will aim for brevity without sacrificing completeness, getting straight to the point while providing sufficient detail.\n*   **Direct Answers:** I will provide direct answers to explicit questions before elaborating or offering additional context.\n*   **Summaries/Key Takeaways:** For lengthy or complex responses, I may include a summary or key takeaways section.\n\n---\n\n### Handling Complexity, Limitations, and Ambiguities Gracefully\n\n*   **Complex Instructions:** I will dissect them into their constituent parts, addressing each component systematically within my response. This demonstrates a methodical approach to complexity.\n*   **Ambiguous Instructions:**\n    *   I will identify the ambiguity clearly.\n    *   I will state any assumptions I make to proceed.\n    *   If possible, I will offer multiple interpretations or potential paths forward based on those interpretations.\n    *   In an interactive setting, I would prioritize asking for clarification.\n*   **Limitations:**\n    *   I will transparently state if a request falls outside my capabilities (e.g., performing actions in the real world, expressing personal opinions, accessing real-time private data).\n    *   I will explain *why* there's a limitation where appropriate (e.g., \"As an AI, I don't have personal experiences...\").\n    *   Where possible, I will offer alternative approaches or suggest what information would be needed to overcome the limitation.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothetical Scenarios and Examples of My Processing\n\nHere are a few examples of how I would apply my processing approach to different types of user instructions:\n\n#### Scenario 1: Technical Problem Description (e.g., \"Write a Python script to analyze customer feedback data and identify common sentiment and keywords.\")\n\n*   **Intent:** User wants a Python script for sentiment analysis and keyword extraction from text data.\n*   **Key Constraints:** Python, customer feedback, sentiment, keywords.\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  **Deconstruct:** Identify needs: input data format (assume CSV/text), sentiment library (NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy), keyword extraction method (TF-IDF, SpaCy entity recognition).\n    2.  **Plan:** Outline script structure: data loading, preprocessing, sentiment analysis loop, keyword extraction, result aggregation, output format (console, CSV).\n    3.  **Formulate Response:** Provide well-commented Python code.\n    4.  **Include Examples:** Show example input data and expected output. Explain library choices.\n    5.  **Acknowledge Limitations:** Mention the limitations of rule-based vs. machine learning sentiment models, data privacy for real feedback.\n*   **Output Structure:**\n    *   Understanding the Request\n    *   Python Script (Code Block)\n    *   Explanation of Code Sections\n    *   How to Use (Dependencies, Execution)\n    *   Example Input/Output\n    *   Considerations and Limitations\n\n#### Scenario 2: Creative/Strategic Instruction (e.g., \"Draft a marketing campaign idea for a new eco-friendly water bottle, targeting Gen Z.\")\n\n*   **Intent:** User wants creative marketing ideas for a specific product and demographic.\n*   **Key Constraints:** Eco-friendly water bottle, Gen Z target, campaign *idea*.\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  **Deconstruct:** Research Gen Z values (sustainability, authenticity, digital engagement), identify key features of eco-friendly bottles (reusability, materials). Brainstorm campaign angles (community, impact, style).\n    2.  **Plan:** Structure into core message, channels, content ideas, call to action.\n    3.  **Formulate Response:** Develop a cohesive campaign concept.\n    4.  **Include Examples:** Suggest specific social media content types, influencer collaboration ideas, partnership examples.\n    5.  **Acknowledge Limitations:** Note that this is a conceptual draft, requiring market research and budget for implementation.\n*   **Output Structure:**\n    *   Campaign Overview\n    *   Target Audience Insights (Gen Z focus)\n    *   Core Message & Slogan Ideas\n    *   Key Marketing Channels (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, Eco-influencers)\n    *   Content Ideas & Engagement Strategies\n    *   Call to Action (CTA)\n    *   Potential KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)\n    *   Next Steps & Considerations\n\n#### Scenario 3: Information Synthesis with Constraints (e.g., \"Summarize the provided research paper on AI ethics, but focus only on the section about bias detection and mitigation, and keep it under 200 words.\")\n\n*   **Intent:** User wants a concise, filtered summary of specific information from a provided text.\n*   **Key Constraints:** Research paper on AI ethics (assumed to be provided or accessible), focus *only* on bias detection/mitigation, under 200 words.\n*   **Process:**\n    1.  **Deconstruct:** Identify the exact segment of the paper related to bias.

    "raw": "The problem asks us to calculate a \"special sum\" for a given integer `n`. This special sum is defined as:\n1.  If `n` is a single-digit number (0-9), its special sum is `n`.\n2.  If `n` is a multi-digit number, its special sum is the sum of its digits. This process is repeated until the resulting sum is a single-digit number.\n\nThis concept is also known as finding the [digital root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root) of a number.\n\nLet's break down the approaches.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 1: Iterative Summation (Direct Simulation)\n\nThis approach directly simulates the process described: repeatedly summing digits until a single-digit number is obtained.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize a variable, say `current_number`, with the input `n`.\n2.  Enter a loop that continues as long as `current_number` is a multi-digit number (i.e., `current_number >= 10`).\n    a.  Inside this loop, calculate the sum of the digits of `current_number`.\n        *   Initialize `sum_of_digits = 0`.\n        *   Use another inner loop: while `current_number > 0`:\n            *   Add the last digit (`current_number % 10`) to `sum_of_digits`.\n            *   Remove the last digit (`current_number //= 10`).\n    b.  After the inner loop finishes, `sum_of_digits` will hold the sum of digits for the previous `current_number`. Update `current_number = sum_of_digits`.\n3.  Once the outer loop terminates (meaning `current_number` is now a single-digit number), return `current_number`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n = 49):**\n\n1.  `current_number = 49`\n2.  **Outer loop 1:** `49 >= 10` is true.\n    *   `sum_of_digits = 0`\n    *   **Inner loop:**\n        *   `temp_n = 49`: `sum_of_digits += 9` (`sum_of_digits = 9`), `temp_n = 4`\n        *   `temp_n = 4`: `sum_of_digits += 4` (`sum_of_digits = 13`), `temp_n = 0`\n        *   Inner loop ends.\n    *   `current_number = 13`\n3.  **Outer loop 2:** `13 >= 10` is true.\n    *   `sum_of_digits = 0`\n    *   **Inner loop:**\n        *   `temp_n = 13`: `sum_of_digits += 3` (`sum_of_digits = 3`), `temp_n = 1`\n        *   `temp_n = 1`: `sum_of_digits += 1` (`sum_of_digits = 4`), `temp_n = 0`\n        *   Inner loop ends.\n    *   `current_number = 4`\n4.  **Outer loop 3:** `4 >= 10` is false.\n5.  Return `current_number = 4`.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef get_special_sum_iterative(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum of a number by repeatedly adding its digits\n    until a single-digit number is produced.\n\n    Args:\n        n: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n\n    # The loop continues as long as n is a multi-digit number (i.e., >= 10)\n    while n >= 10:\n        current_sum = 0\n        temp_n = n  # Use a temporary variable to calculate sum of digits for the current 'n'\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of digits for temp_n\n        while temp_n > 0:\n            current_sum += temp_n % 10  # Get the last digit\n            temp_n //= 10             # Remove the last digit\n        \n        n = current_sum  # Assign the sum back to 'n' for the next iteration\n\n    return n\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"Special sum for 5: {get_special_sum_iterative(5)}\")        # Expected: 5\nprint(f\"Special sum for 12: {get_special_sum_iterative(12)}\")      # Expected: 3 (1+2)\nprint(f\"Special sum for 49: {get_special_sum_iterative(49)}\")      # Expected: 4 (4+9=13, 1+3=4)\nprint(f\"Special sum for 99: {get_special_sum_iterative(99)}\")      # Expected: 9 (9+9=18, 1+8=9)\nprint(f\"Special sum for 12345: {get_special_sum_iterative(12345)}\") # Expected: 6 (1+2+3+4+5=15, 1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum for 0: {get_special_sum_iterative(0)}\")        # Expected: 0\n\n# print(get_special_sum_iterative(-1)) # This would raise a ValueError\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nThe outer `while` loop runs `log_10(n)` times in the worst case (e.g., `999` -> `27` -> `9`). The inner `while` loop also runs `log_10(n)` times to sum the digits. So, the complexity is roughly `O(log n * log n)`. However, since the numbers decrease rapidly, it's more accurately `O(log N)` where N is the original number, because the number of digits in `n` drops very quickly. The sum of digits of an `M`-digit number is at most `9M`. So, if `n` has `M` digits, the next number has at most `log(n) * 9` digits, which is much smaller than `n`. This effectively makes it closer to `O(log n)`.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n`O(1)` as we only use a few variables.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Mathematical Property (Digital Root Formula)\n\nThere's a well-known mathematical shortcut for finding the digital root of a non-negative integer `n`:\n\n*   If `n = 0`, the digital root is `0`.\n*   If `n > 0`, the digital root is `(n - 1) % 9 + 1`.\n\n**Why does this formula work?**\n\nThe digital root is essentially the remainder when a number is divided by 9, with the exception that if the remainder is 0 and the number is not 0, the digital root is 9.\n*   Any positive integer `n` is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9. (e.g., `123 = 1*100 + 2*10 + 3`. `100 % 9 = 1`, `10 % 9 = 1`. So `123 % 9 = (1*1 + 2*1 + 3) % 9 = 6 % 9 = 6`). This property holds repeatedly.\n*   Therefore, `n % 9` will give the digital root, *unless* `n` is a multiple of 9 (and not 0), in which case `n % 9` is 0, but the digital root is 9.\n*   The formula `(n - 1) % 9 + 1` correctly handles this:\n    *   If `n` is a multiple of 9 (e.g., 9, 18, 99), then `n - 1` will be `8, 17, 98`.\n    *   `(n - 1) % 9` will be `8, 8, 8`.\n    *   Adding 1 gives `9`.\n    *   If `n` is not a multiple of 9 (e.g., 5, 12, 49), then `n - 1` is `4, 11, 48`.\n    *   `(n - 1) % 9` will be `4, 2, 3`.\n    *   Adding 1 gives `5, 3, 4`.\n    *   For `n = 0`, the formula `(0 - 1) % 9 + 1` would be `(-1) % 9 + 1`. In Python, `-1 % 9` is `8`, so `8 + 1 = 9`. This is incorrect for `n=0`. So `n=0` needs to be a special case.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef get_special_sum_optimized(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum (digital root) using a mathematical formula.\n\n    Args:\n        n: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    return (n - 1) % 9 + 1\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"Special sum for 5: {get_special_sum_optimized(5)}\")        # Expected: 5\nprint(f\"Special sum for 12: {get_special_sum_optimized(12)}\")      # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"Special sum for 49: {get_special_sum_optimized(49)}\")      # Expected: 4\nprint(f\"Special sum for 99: {get_special_sum_optimized(99)}\")      # Expected: 9\nprint(f\"Special sum for 12345: {get_special_sum_optimized(12345)}\") # Expected: 6\nprint(f\"Special sum for 0: {get_special_sum_optimized(0)}\")        # Expected: 0\n\n# print(get_special_sum_optimized(-1)) # This would raise a ValueError\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n`O(1)` as it involves a constant number of arithmetic operations. This is the most efficient approach.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n`O(1)`.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth approaches correctly solve the problem.\n\n*   The **iterative approach** (using `get_special_sum_iterative`) directly translates the problem description into code and is easy to understand without prior mathematical knowledge of digital roots.\n*   The **mathematical approach** (using `get_special_sum_optimized`) is significantly more efficient for large numbers, achieving `O(1)` time complexity, but relies on knowing the digital root formula.\n\nFor typical interview scenarios, either is acceptable, but the `O(1)` solution is often preferred if known.",

This dictionary directly maps to the desired JSON structure.\n    *   **Top-level keys**: `id`, `name`, `email` are set.\n    *   **Dynamic Values**: For `name`, `email`, and all `address` components, f-strings (formatted string literals) are used to embed the `user_id` into the string, making each user's data unique based on their ID.\n    *   **Nested Dictionary**: The `address` key holds another dictionary, creating the nested structure required.\n    *   **`zipcode` Formatting**: `f\"1000{user_id:02d}-9999\"` demonstrates a slightly more advanced f-string format. `:02d` ensures that `user_id` is padded with a leading zero if it's a single digit (e.g., `1` becomes `01`, `10` remains `10`).\n4.  **`return user_data`**: The function returns the constructed dictionary.\n5.  **`json.dumps(user_dict, indent=4)`**:\n    *   `json.dumps()` converts a Python dictionary (or other Python object) into a JSON formatted string.\n    *   `indent=4` is an optional argument that makes the JSON output human-readable by adding indentation (4 spaces per level) and newlines. Without it, the JSON would be a single line string.\n\nThis solution provides a flexible way to generate mock user data with a specific structure based on a simple input ID.",

Initialize a counter, `effective_length`, to 0.\n2.  Loop through each `char` in the input string.\n3.  Inside the loop:\n    *   If `char.isalnum()` is `True` OR `char.isspace()` is `True`:\n        *   Add 1 to `effective_length`.\n    *   Else (the character is special):\n        *   Add 2 to `effective_length`.\n4.  After the loop, return `effective_length`.\n\n**Python Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_special_length(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 'special length' of a string where special characters\n    count as 2 units and regular characters (alphanumeric, whitespace)\n    count as 1 unit.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The calculated special length as an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    effective_length = 0\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is alphanumeric or whitespace\n        if char.isalnum() or char.isspace():\n            effective_length += 1\n        else:\n            # If not alphanumeric and not whitespace, it's a special character\n            effective_length += 2\n    return effective_length\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"'hello' -> {calculate_special_length('hello')}\")         # Expected: 5 (1+1+1+1+1)\nprint(f\"'hello!' -> {calculate_special_length('hello!')}\")       # Expected: 7 (1+1+1+1+1+2)\nprint(f\"'hello world' -> {calculate_special_length('hello world')}\") # Expected: 11 (1*10 for letters + 1*1 for space)\nprint(f\"'abc-123' -> {calculate_special_length('abc-123')}\")     # Expected: 8 (1*3 + 2*1 + 1*3)\nprint(f\"'@#$' -> {calculate_special_length('@#$')}\")             # Expected: 6 (2+2+2)\nprint(f\"'' (empty) -> {calculate_special_length('')}\")          # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"' ' (space) -> {calculate_special_length(' ')}\")        # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"'\\t' (tab) -> {calculate_special_length('\\t')}\")        # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"'Python rocks!!!' -> {calculate_special_length('Python rocks!!!')}\") # Expected: 19 (P(1)y(1)t(1)h(1)o(1)n(1) (1)r(1)o(1)c(1)k(1)s(1)!(2)!(2)!(2))\n```\n\n**More Concise Pythonic Version (using a generator expression with `sum`)**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_special_length_v2(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 'special length' of a string using a concise sum approach.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(1 if char.isalnum() or char.isspace() else 2 for char in s)\n\n# --- Test Cases for v2 ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Concise Version ---\")\nprint(f\"'hello' -> {calculate_special_length_v2('hello')}\")\nprint(f\"'hello!' -> {calculate_special_length_v2('hello!')}\")\nprint(f\"'Python rocks!!!' -> {calculate_special_length_v2('Python rocks!!!')}\")\n```",

When this happens, the contribution from that branch of the calculation is 0. So, if `a` or `b` is 0, the function should return 0.\n2.  **Recursive Step:**\n    *   Take the last digit of `a` (`a % 10`).\n    *   Take the last digit of `b` (`b % 10`).\n    *   Multiply these two digits.\n    *   Add this product to the result of a new `special_multiply` call where `a` and `b` have had their last digits removed (integer division: `a // 10` and `b // 10`).\n\n**Let's trace an example: `special_multiply(123, 45)`**\n\n1.  `special_multiply(123, 45)`\n    *   `last_a = 3`, `last_b = 5`\n    *   `product = 3 * 5 = 15`\n    *   `remaining_a = 12`, `remaining_b = 4`\n    *   Returns `15 + special_multiply(12, 4)`\n\n2.  `special_multiply(12, 4)`\n    *   `last_a = 2`, `last_b = 4`\n    *   `product = 2 * 4 = 8`\n    *   `remaining_a = 1`, `remaining_b = 0`\n    *   Returns `8 + special_multiply(1, 0)`\n\n3.  `special_multiply(1, 0)`\n    *   `b` is 0. This is the base case.\n    *   Returns `0`\n\n**Substitute back:**\n\n*   `special_multiply(12, 4)` returns `8 + 0 = 8`\n*   `special_multiply(123, 45)` returns `15 + 8 = 23`\n\nThis matches the example, confirming our logic.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef special_multiply(a, b):\n  \"\"\"\n  Performs a special multiplication operation recursively.\n\n  Args:\n    a: A positive integer.\n    b: A positive integer.\n\n  Returns:\n    The result of the special multiply operation.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Base case: if either number becomes 0, stop the recursion and return 0\n  if a == 0 or b == 0:\n    return 0\n\n  # Get the last digit of each number\n  last_digit_a = a % 10\n  last_digit_b = b % 10\n\n  # Calculate the product of the last digits\n  current_product = last_digit_a * last_digit_b\n\n  # Recursively call the function with the numbers without their last digits\n  # and add the current product to its result\n  return current_product + special_multiply(a // 10, b // 10)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"special_multiply(123, 45) = {special_multiply(123, 45)}\")    # Expected: 23\nprint(f\"special_multiply(1, 1) = {special_multiply(1, 1)}\")          # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"special_multiply(12, 34) = {special_multiply(12, 34)}\")      # Expected: 11 (2*4 + 1*3 = 8 + 3)\nprint(f\"special_multiply(5, 0) = {special_multiply(5, 0)}\")          # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"special_multiply(0, 10) = {special_multiply(0, 10)}\")        # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"special_multiply(7, 8) = {special_multiply(7, 8)}\")          # Expected: 56 (7*8 + sm(0,0) = 56 + 0)\nprint(f\"special_multiply(10, 20) = {special_multiply(10, 20)}\")      # Expected: 0 (0*0 + sm(1,2) = 0 + 2 = 2, WRONG! 0*0 + sm(1,2) = 0 + (1*2 + sm(0,0)) = 0 + 2 = 2)\n# Let's re-trace special_multiply(10, 20) for correction\n# sm(10, 20): 0*0 + sm(1,2) = 0 + sm(1,2)\n# sm(1, 2): 1*2 + sm(0,0) = 2 + 0 = 2\n# Result: 0 + 2 = 2.\n# So special_multiply(10, 20) = 2, not 0.

    "raw": "The problem describes a \"special sum\" for a non-negative integer `n`. Let's break down the definition and then find a pattern or formula.\n\nThe sum starts with `n`, then adds `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., until `0` is reached. From there, it continues to `-1`, `-2`, ..., until `-n` is reached. The rule is:\n*   If the number being considered is non-negative (>= 0), add it.\n*   If the number being considered is negative (< 0), subtract it.\n\nLet's test with the given examples:\n\n1.  **`n = 0`**:\n    *   Sequence: `0`\n    *   Rule: `0` is non-negative, so add `0`.\n    *   Sum: `0`\n    *   This matches the example.\n\n2.  **`n = 1`**:\n    *   Sequence: `1, 0, -1`\n    *   Rule:\n        *   `1` is non-negative, add `1`. Current sum: `1`.\n        *   `0` is non-negative, add `0`. Current sum: `1 + 0 = 1`.\n        *   `-1` is negative, subtract `-1`. Current sum: `1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Sum: `2`\n    *   This matches the example.\n\n3.  **`n = 3`**:\n    *   Sequence: `3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3`\n    *   Rule:\n        *   `3`: add `3`. Sum: `3`\n        *   `2`: add `2`. Sum: `3 + 2 = 5`\n        *   `1`: add `1`. Sum: `5 + 1 = 6`\n        *   `0`: add `0`. Sum: `6 + 0 = 6`\n        *   `-1`: subtract `-1`. Sum: `6 - (-1) = 6 + 1 = 7`\n        *   `-2`: subtract `-2`. Sum: `7 - (-2) = 7 + 2 = 9`\n        *   `-3`: subtract `-3`. Sum: `9 - (-3) = 9 + 3 = 12`\n    *   Sum: `12`\n    *   This matches the example.\n\n**Observation and Simplification:**\n\nNotice that \"subtracting a negative number\" is the same as \"adding its positive counterpart\".\n*   `X - (-Y)` is `X + Y`.\n*   So, `X - (-1)` is `X + 1`.\n*   And `X - (-2)` is `X + 2`.\n\nThis means the rule can be simplified: for every number `k` in the sequence from `n` down to `-n`, we add its absolute value (`abs(k)`) to the sum.\n\nLet's re-check `n = 3` with this simplified rule:\nSequence: `3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3`\nAbsolute values: `abs(3), abs(2), abs(1), abs(0), abs(-1), abs(-2), abs(-3)`\nWhich are: `3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3`\nSum: `3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 12`. This works!\n\nSo, the special sum is `sum_{i=-n}^{n} abs(i)`.\n\nThis sum can be written as:\n`abs(-n) + abs(-(n-1)) + ... + abs(-1) + abs(0) + abs(1) + ... + abs(n-1) + abs(n)`\n`= n + (n-1) + ... + 1 + 0 + 1 + ... + (n-1) + n`\n\nThis is equivalent to `2 * (1 + 2 + ... + n) + 0`.\n\nThe sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`1 + 2 + ... + n`) is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\nTherefore, the special sum is `2 * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.\nSimplifying this, we get `n * (n + 1)`.\n\n**Let's verify the formula `n * (n + 1)` with our examples:**\n*   `n = 0`: `0 * (0 + 1) = 0 * 1 = 0`. Correct.\n*   `n = 1`: `1 * (1 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2`. Correct.\n*   `n = 3`: `3 * (3 + 1) = 3 * 4 = 12`. Correct.\n\nThis formula provides an `O(1)` solution (constant time complexity) for any non-negative `n`.\n\n```python\ndef special_sum(n: int) -> int:\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the \"special sum\" for a given non-negative integer n.\n\n  The sum includes numbers from n down to -n.\n  For non-negative numbers (n, n-1, ..., 0), they are added.\n  For negative numbers (-1, -2, ..., -n), they are subtracted.\n\n  Example:\n  n = 3\n  Sequence: 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3\n  Sum: 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 - (-1) - (-2) - (-3)\n       = 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3\n       = 12\n\n  This is equivalent to summing the absolute values of numbers from n down to -n:\n  abs(n) + abs(n-1) + ... + abs(0) + ... + abs(-n+1) + abs(-n)\n  Which simplifies to:\n  2 * (1 + 2 + ... + n) + 0\n  Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers (n * (n + 1) / 2):\n  2 * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n * (n + 1)\n  \"\"\"\n  if n < 0:\n    # The problem states n is a non-negative integer.\n    # If it were allowed, the formula still holds due to properties of abs().\n    # However, to strictly follow problem constraints:\n    raise ValueError(\"Input n must be a non-negative integer.\")\n\n  return n * (n + 1)\n\n```",

We want to find the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed on a screen given `N` keystrokes.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the maximum number of 'A's we can get with `i` keystrokes.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   For `i < 1`, `dp[i] = 0`.\n    *   For `i` from 1 to 6: It's always optimal to just press 'A' `i` times. The Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V sequence requires at least 3 keystrokes (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V) to be potentially useful. Even with 3 strokes, it takes 3 'A's (AAA) -> 3 'A's. With 4 strokes, it takes 4 'A's -> 4 'A's. With 5 strokes, it takes 5 'A's -> 5 'A's. With 6 strokes, you can either print 6 'A's, or (AAA, CA, CC, CV) for 6 'A's. So for `i <= 6`, `dp[i] = i`.\n    *   `dp[0] = 0`\n    *   `dp[1] = 1`\n    *   `dp[2] = 2`\n    *   `dp[3] = 3`\n    *   `dp[4] = 4`\n    *   `dp[5] = 5`\n    *   `dp[6] = 6`\n\n2.  **General Case (for `i > 6`):**\n    For any `i` keystrokes, there are two main strategies:\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Just press 'A'.**\n        If the last keystroke was printing 'A', then we would have `dp[i-1]` 'A's and add one more.\n        So, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Use Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V sequence.**\n        To use this sequence effectively, we must have built up some text, then copied it, then pasted it one or more times.\n        Let's say we used `j` keystrokes to build `dp[j]` 'A's.\n        The remaining `i - j` keystrokes are then used for Ctrl operations.\n        The Ctrl operations always start with `Ctrl-A` (select all), `Ctrl-C` (copy). This costs 2 keystrokes.\n        The remaining `(i - j - 2)` keystrokes must be for `Ctrl-V` (paste) operations.\n        Let `num_pastes = i - j - 2`.\n        Each paste operation duplicates the content of the buffer. If we have `dp[j]` 'A's initially, and `num_pastes` operations, the total 'A's will be:\n        `dp[j]` (original content) + `dp[j] * num_pastes` (pasted content)\n        `= dp[j] * (1 + num_pastes)`\n        `= dp[j] * (1 + (i - j - 2))`\n        `= dp[j] * (i - j - 1)`\n\n        We need to iterate through all possible values of `j` (the number of keystrokes used to build the initial text) to find the maximum.\n        *   `j` can range from `1` (minimum 'A's to copy) up to `i-3` (to allow for at least `Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V` after building the initial text).\n        *   So for each `i`, we consider `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1))` for `j` from `1` to `i-3`.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxA(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n <= 6:\n            return n\n\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n        # Base cases: For N up to 6, it's always optimal to just print 'A' N times.\n        # This is because Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V sequence takes at least 3 strokes\n        # and doesn't become profitable until N=7.\n        for i in range(1, 7):\n            if i <= n: # Ensure we don't go out of bounds if n is very small\n                dp[i] = i\n\n        # For N > 6\n        for i in range(7, n + 1):\n            # Option 1: Just print 'A'\n            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1\n\n            # Option 2: Use Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V sequence\n            # Iterate through all possible previous states 'j' where we made a copy.\n            # 'j' is the number of keystrokes to build the initial 'A's (dp[j])\n            # The remaining (i - j) strokes are for Ctrl operations:\n            #   - 1 for Ctrl-A\n            #   - 1 for Ctrl-C\n            #   - (i - j - 2) for Ctrl-V operations\n            # The total multiplier is 1 (original copied text) + (i - j - 2) (Ctrl-V operations) = (i - j - 1)\n            # The loop for 'j' must ensure:\n            # 1. We have at least 1 'A' to copy (j >= 1)\n            # 2. We have at least 3 strokes for Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V (i - j >= 3  =>  j <= i - 3)\n            for j in range(1, i - 2): # j goes up to i-3. So range(1, (i-3)+1) = range(1, i-2)\n                # The multiplier is (number of Ctrl-V presses + 1)\n                # Number of Ctrl-V presses = (total Ctrl strokes) - (Ctrl-A + Ctrl-C strokes)\n                #                       = (i - j) - 2\n                # Multiplier = 1 (initial copy) + (i - j - 2) = (i - j - 1)\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1))\n        \n        return dp[n]\n\n```",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to find the longest string in a given dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters from a given string `s`. If there are multiple such strings with the same maximum length, we should return the one that is lexicographically smallest.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1.  **Check if a word can be formed from `s` by deleting characters:** This means we need to determine if a `word` from the `dictionary` is a *subsequence* of `s`.\n2.  **Iterate and compare:** We need to go through each word in the dictionary, apply the check from step 1, and keep track of the best candidate based on length and then lexicographical order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Checking for Subsequence\n\nTo check if `target_word` is a subsequence of `source_string`, we can use a two-pointer approach:\n\n*   Initialize two pointers, `i` for `source_string` and `j` for `target_word`, both starting at 0.\n*   Iterate `i` from 0 to `len(source_string) - 1`.\n*   If `source_string[i]` matches `target_word[j]`, it means we've found the current character needed for `target_word`, so increment `j`.\n*   Always increment `i`.\n*   After the loop, if `j` has reached `len(target_word)`, it means all characters of `target_word` were found in `source_string` in the correct order, so `target_word` is a subsequence.\n\n**Example:**\n`source_string = \"abpcplea\"`, `target_word = \"apple\"`\n\n1.  `i=0, s[0]='a'`, `j=0, word[0]='a'`. Match. `j` becomes 1.\n2.  `i=1, s[1]='b'`, `j=1, word[1]='p'`. No match.\n3.  `i=2, s[2]='p'`, `j=1, word[1]='p'`. Match. `j` becomes 2.\n4.  `i=3, s[3]='c'`, `j=2, word[2]='p'`. No match.\n5.  `i=4, s[4]='p'`, `j=2, word[2]='p'`. Match. `j` becomes 3.\n6.  `i=5, s[5]='l'`, `j=3, word[3]='l'`. Match. `j` becomes 4.\n7.  `i=6, s[6]='e'`, `j=4, word[4]='e'`. Match. `j` becomes 5.\n8.  `i=7` (end of `s`). `j` is 5, which is `len(\"apple\")`. So, \"apple\" is a subsequence.\n\nThis `is_subsequence` function takes `O(len(source_string))` time in the worst case.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Iterate and Compare\n\n1.  Initialize a variable, say `longest_word_found`, to an empty string `\"\"`. This will store our best candidate.\n2.  Iterate through each `word` in the `dictionary`.\n3.  For each `word`:\n    *   Call `is_subsequence(s, word)`.\n    *   If `word` *is* a subsequence:\n        *   **Length Check:** If `len(word)` is greater than `len(longest_word_found)`, then `word` is a new best candidate. Update `longest_word_found = word`.\n        *   **Lexicographical Check (for tie-breaking):** If `len(word)` is equal to `len(longest_word_found)`, we need to choose the lexicographically smaller one. If `word < longest_word_found` (Python's string comparison naturally handles this), then `word` is a better candidate. Update `longest_word_found = word`.\n4.  After checking all words in the dictionary, `longest_word_found` will hold the desired result.\n\n---\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\n`s = \"abpcplea\"`, `dictionary = [\"ale\",\"apple\",\"monkey\",\"plea\"]`\n\n1.  `longest_word_found = \"\"` (length 0)\n\n2.  **`word = \"ale\"`:**\n    *   `is_subsequence(\"abpcplea\", \"ale\")` -> True (a_b_pc_pl_ea -> ale)\n    *   `len(\"ale\")` (3) > `len(\"\")` (0).\n    *   `longest_word_found = \"ale\"`.\n\n3.  **`word = \"apple\"`:**\n    *   `is_subsequence(\"abpcplea\", \"apple\")` -> True (ab_p_c_p_l_e_a -> apple)\n    *   `len(\"apple\")` (5) > `len(\"ale\")` (3).\n    *   `longest_word_found = \"apple\"`.\n\n4.  **`word = \"monkey\"`:**\n    *   `is_subsequence(\"abpcplea\", \"monkey\")` -> False (No 'm', 'o', 'n', 'k', 'y' in `s` in order).\n    *   `longest_word_found` remains \"apple\".\n\n5.  **`word = \"plea\"`:**\n    *   `is_subsequence(\"abpcplea\", \"plea\")` -> True (ab_p_c_p_l_e_a -> plea)\n    *   `len(\"plea\")` (4) is not > `len(\"apple\")` (5).\n    *   `len(\"plea\")` (4) is not == `len(\"apple\")` (5).\n    *   `longest_word_found` remains \"apple\".\n\n6.  End of dictionary. Return `longest_word_found` which is `\"apple\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Python Implementation\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findLongestWord(self, s: str, dictionary: list[str]) -> str:\n        longest_word_found = \"\"\n\n        # Helper function to check if target_word is a subsequence of source_string\n        def is_subsequence(source_string: str, target_word: str) -> bool:\n            i = 0  # Pointer for source_string\n            j = 0  # Pointer for target_word\n            while i < len(source_string) and j < len(target_word):\n                if source_string[i] == target_word[j]:\n                    j += 1\n                i += 1\n            # If j has reached the end of target_word, it means all characters were found\n            return j == len(target_word)\n\n        for word in dictionary:\n            if is_subsequence(s, word):\n                # First, check if the current word is longer\n                if len(word) > len(longest_word_found):\n                    longest_word_found = word\n                # If lengths are equal, check lexicographical order\n                elif len(word) == len(longest_word_found):\n                    if word < longest_word_found: # Python's string comparison is lexicographical\n                        longest_word_found = word\n        \n        return longest_word_found\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Let `N` be the length of the string `s`.\n    *   Let `M` be the number of words in `dictionary`.\n    *   Let `L_max` be the maximum length of a word in `dictionary`.\n    *   The `is_subsequence` function takes `O(N)` time (as it iterates through `s`).\n    *   We call `is_subsequence` for each of the `M` words in the dictionary.\n    *   Inside the loop, length comparisons are `O(1)`. Lexicographical comparison `word < longest_word_found` takes `O(L_max)` time in the worst case.\n    *   Therefore, the total time complexity is `M * (O(N) + O(L_max))`, which simplifies to `O(M * (N + L_max))`.\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `longest_word_found` stores at most `L_max` characters.\n    *   The `is_subsequence` function uses a few constant variables.\n    *   Thus, the space complexity is `O(L_max)` to store the result, or `O(1)` if we don't count the output string size. Since we're just storing a string from the input, it's often considered `O(1)` auxiliary space.\n\n---",

It splits the string into at most two parts. The first part is the command (`\"SET\"`). The second part is the *rest* of the string (`\"name=Alice age=30 city=New York\"`), which contains all the key-value arguments, preserving internal spaces in values.\n2.  **`re.compile(r'(\\w+)=(.+?)(?=\\s\\w+=|\\s*$)')`**:\n    *   `(\\w+)`: This is the first capturing group for the **key**. `\\w+` matches one or more \"word characters\" (alphanumeric and underscore).\n    *   `=`: Matches the literal equals sign.\n    *   `(.+?)`: This is the second capturing group for the **value**. `.` matches any character (except newline), and `+?` makes it match one or more times, but *non-greedily*. This non-greediness is vital. It will match as few characters as possible.\n    *   `(?=\\s\\w+=|\\s*$)`: This is a **positive lookahead assertion**. It means \"the preceding pattern must be followed by one of these patterns, but don't include those characters in the match.\"\n        *   `\\s\\w+=`: Looks for a space, then another key-like word, then an equals sign. This signals the start of the *next* key-value pair.\n        *   `|`: OR\n        *   `\\s*$`: Looks for optional whitespace followed by the end of the string. This handles the last key-value pair.\n3.  **`pattern.findall(args_string)`**: This finds all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in `args_string` and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the captured groups (key, value).\n4.  **`for key, value in key_value_pairs:`**: We iterate through the found pairs.\n5.  **`params[key.strip()] = value.strip()`**: We add them to our `params` dictionary. `strip()` is used to clean up any potential leading/trailing whitespace that might be captured around the key or value.\n\nThis solution is robust for the specified format, correctly handling spaces within values and the separation of distinct key-value pairs.",

    "raw": "This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Flask application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n\n**Goal:**\nAutomatically build, test, and deploy your Flask application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk every time you push code to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.  **Introduction**\n2.  **Prerequisites**\n3.  **Project Structure**\n4.  **Step 1: Set up Flask Application**\n    *   `app/__init__.py`\n    *   `app/routes.py`\n    *   `app/tests/test_app.py`\n    *   `wsgi.py`\n    *   `requirements.txt`\n    *   `Dockerfile`\n    *   `.dockerignore`\n    *   `Dockerrun.aws.json`\n5.  **Step 2: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Setup**\n    *   Create IAM User for GitHub Actions\n    *   Create Elastic Beanstalk Application and Environment\n6.  **Step 3: GitHub Secrets Configuration**\n7.  **Step 4: GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)**\n8.  **Step 5: Testing the Pipeline**\n9.  **Troubleshooting**\n10. **Further Improvements**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis setup will provide a robust CI/CD pipeline:\n\n*   **Continuous Integration (CI):**\n    *   Whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will trigger.\n    *   It will build the Docker image for your Flask application.\n    *   It will run your application's tests within the Docker container.\n    *   If tests pass, it proceeds to the deployment phase.\n*   **Continuous Deployment (CD):**\n    *   A deployment package (`.zip`) containing your application code, `Dockerfile`, and `Dockerrun.aws.json` is created.\n    *   This package is uploaded to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n    *   Elastic Beanstalk automatically pulls the necessary components, builds the Docker image (if not already built from ECR), and deploys your application instances.\n\n## 2. Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n*   **GitHub Account:** With a repository for your Flask application.\n*   **AWS Account:** With administrative access to create IAM users, Elastic Beanstalk applications, and S3 buckets.\n*   **Docker:** Installed locally (for testing your Docker setup).\n*   **AWS CLI:** Installed locally (optional, but useful for initial setup and debugging).\n*   **Basic understanding of Flask, Docker, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.**\n\n## 3. Project Structure\n\nYour project directory should look like this:\n\n```\nmy-flask-app/\n├── .github/\n│   └── workflows/\n│       └── main.yml           # GitHub Actions workflow file\n├── app/\n│   ├── __init__.py            # Flask application entry\n│   ├── routes.py              # Flask routes\n│   └── tests/\n│       └── test_app.py        # Pytest tests\n├── .dockerignore              # Files to ignore in Docker build context\n├── Dockerrun.aws.json         # Elastic Beanstalk configuration for Docker\n├── Dockerfile                 # Defines the Docker image\n├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies\n└── wsgi.py                    # Gunicorn entry point for Flask\n```\n\n## 4. Step 1: Set up Flask Application\n\nLet's create the necessary files for your Flask application.\n\n### `app/__init__.py`\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\ndef create_app():\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    # Register blueprints or configurations here\n    from . import routes\n    app.register_blueprint(routes.bp)\n\n    return app\n```\n\n### `app/routes.py`\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Blueprint\n\nbp = Blueprint('main', __name__)\n\n@bp.route('/')\ndef hello():\n    \"\"\"Simple hello world route.\"\"\"\n    return \"Hello from Flask on Elastic Beanstalk with CI/CD!\"\n\n@bp.route('/health')\ndef health_check():\n    \"\"\"Health check endpoint for load balancers.\"\"\"\n    return \"OK\", 200\n```\n\n### `app/tests/test_app.py`\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom app import create_app\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef client():\n    \"\"\"Configures the Flask app for testing.\"\"\"\n    app = create_app()\n    app.config['TESTING'] = True\n    with app.test_client() as client:\n        yield client\n\ndef test_hello_world(client):\n    \"\"\"Tests the root endpoint.\"\"\"\n    rv = client.get('/')\n    assert rv.status_code == 200\n    assert b'Hello from Flask on Elastic Beanstalk with CI/CD!' in rv.data\n\ndef test_health_check(client):\n    \"\"\"Tests the health check endpoint.\"\"\"\n    rv = client.get('/health')\n    assert rv.status_code == 200\n    assert b'OK' in rv.data\n```\n\n### `wsgi.py`\n\nThis file is the entry point for Gunicorn, a common web server for Python applications, which Elastic Beanstalk will use.\n\n```python\nfrom app import create_app\n\n# Create the Flask app instance\napp = create_app()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### `requirements.txt`\n\n```\nFlask==2.3.3\ngunicorn==21.2.0\npytest==7.4.3\n```\n*Note: `pytest` is included here so it's available in the Docker image for CI/CD testing. For a production-only image, you might use a multi-stage build to exclude it.*\n\n### `Dockerfile`\n\nThis defines how your Flask application is containerized.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use a slim Python base image\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\n\n# Set the working directory inside the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the rest of the application code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Expose the port your Flask app will run on\nEXPOSE 5000\n\n# Command to run the application using Gunicorn\n# wsgi:app refers to the 'app' variable in wsgi.py\nCMD [\"gunicorn\", \"--bind\", \"0.0.0.0:5000\", \"wsgi:app\"]\n```\n\n### `.dockerignore`\n\nSimilar to `.gitignore`, this prevents unnecessary files from being copied into your Docker image, reducing image size and build time.\n\n```\n.git\n.gitignore\n.dockerignore\n__pycache__\n*.pyc\n*.log\n.vscode/\nvenv/\n.env\nDockerfile\nDockerrun.aws.json\n```\n\n### `Dockerrun.aws.json`\n\nThis file tells Elastic Beanstalk how to deploy your Dockerized application.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"AWSEBDockerrunVersion\": \"1\",\n  \"Image\": {\n    \"Name\": \"my-flask-app\",\n    \"Update\": \"true\"\n  },\n  \"Ports\": [\n    {\n      \"ContainerPort\": \"5000\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"Volumes\": [\n    {\n      \"HostDirectory\": \"/var/app/log\",\n      \"ContainerDirectory\": \"/var/log/app\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"Logging\": \"/var/log/app\"\n}\n```\n\n*   `AWSEBDockerrunVersion`: Specifies the version of the `Dockerrun.aws.json` format.\n*   `Image.Name`: A placeholder. When you provide a `Dockerfile` in your deployment bundle, Elastic Beanstalk builds the image itself.\n*   `Ports.ContainerPort`: The port your Docker container exposes (must match `EXPOSE` in `Dockerfile`).\n*   `Volumes` and `Logging`: Optional, but good practice for log management. This maps a directory on the host to a directory in the container for logs.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Step 2: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Setup\n\n### Create IAM User for GitHub Actions\n\nGitHub Actions needs AWS credentials to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk. It's best practice to create a dedicated IAM user with limited permissions.\n\n1.  Go to the AWS IAM Console.\n2.  Navigate to **Users** -> **Add users**.\n3.  Enter a user name (e.g., `github-actions-flask-eb`).\n4.  Select **Access key - Programmatic access**. Click **Next**.\n5.  On the Permissions page, select **Attach existing policies directly**.\n6.  Search for and attach the following policies:\n    *   `AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess` (Allows full control over EB applications and environments)\n    *   `AmazonS3FullAccess` (Allows GHA to upload deployment packages to S3, which EB uses)\n    *   *For production, consider creating a custom policy with only the specific permissions needed (e.g., `s3:PutObject` on a specific bucket, `elasticbeanstalk:CreateApplicationVersion`, `elasticbeanstalk:UpdateEnvironment`).*\n7.  Click **Next**, then **Create user**.\n8.  **Important:** Copy the `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`. You will need these for GitHub Secrets. **Do not close this window until you have saved them.**\n\n### Create Elastic Beanstalk Application and Environment\n\n1.  Go to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console.\n2.  Click **Create a new environment**.\n3.  Choose **Web server environment**. Click **Select**.\n4.  **Environment name:** Enter `MyFlaskWebApp-env` (or your desired name).\n    *   The application name will automatically be `MyFlaskWebApp`.\n5.  **Platform:** Select **Docker**.\n6.  **Application code:** Choose **Sample application** for now. We'll deploy our own code via GitHub Actions later.\n7.  Click **Create environment**.\n8.  Wait for the environment to provision (this can take several minutes).\n\n**Once the environment is running:**\n\n*   Go to your environment's configuration page.\n*   Under **Software**, click **Edit**.\n*   Ensure that the **Proxy server** is set to `Nginx` (default).\n*   If you need to change the **Container port**, ensure it matches the `EXPOSE` in your `Dockerfile` and `ContainerPort` in `Dockerrun.aws.json` (which is 5000 in our case).\n*   Go to **Load balancer** (if using one) -> **Listeners**. Ensure the HTTP listener is configured correctly and the health check path is `/health` (our custom health check endpoint).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Step 3: GitHub Secrets Configuration\n\nYou need to store your AWS credentials securely in your GitHub repository.\n\n1.  Go to your GitHub repository.\n2.  Click on **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.\n3.  Click **New repository secret**.\n4.  Create two secrets:\n    *   **Name:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n        *   **Value:** Your AWS IAM user's Access Key ID\n    *   **Name:** `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\n        *   **Value:** Your AWS IAM user's Secret Access Key\n\n---\n\n## 7. Step 4: GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)\n\nCreate the file `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nname: Flask CI/CD to AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main # Trigger on pushes to the main branch\n\nenv:\n  AWS_REGION: us-east-1             # Your AWS region (e.g., us-west-2, eu-central-1)\n  EB_APPLICATION_NAME: MyFlaskWebApp # The name of your Elastic Beanstalk application\n  EB_ENVIRONMENT_NAME: MyFlaskWebApp-env # The name of your Elastic Beanstalk environment\n\njobs:\n  build_and_test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Build Docker image\n        run: docker build -t my-flask-app .\n\n      - name: Run tests inside Docker container\n        # This command runs pytest within the built Docker image\n        run: docker run my-flask-app python -m pytest /app/tests\n\n      - name: Create deployment package\n        # Zip all necessary files for Elastic Beanstalk deployment\n        # The .zip file should contain: Dockerfile, Dockerrun.aws.json, wsgi.py, requirements.txt, and the app/ directory\n        run: |\n          zip -r deploy.zip . -x \".git/*\" \".github/*\" \"*/__pycache__/*\" \"*.DS_Store\"\n\n      - name: Upload deployment package as artifact\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        with:\n          name: flask-app-deploy\n          path: deploy.zip\n          retention-days: 5 # Keep artifact for 5 days\n\n  deploy:\n    needs: build_and_test # This job depends on the build_and_test job succeeding\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Download deployment package artifact\n        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3\n        with:\n          name: flask-app-deploy\n          path: . # Downloads deploy.zip to the current directory\n\n      - name: Configure AWS credentials\n        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2\n        with:\n          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}\n\n      - name: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk\n        uses: aws-actions/elastic-beanstalk-deploy@v1\n        with:\n          application_name: ${{ env.EB_APPLICATION_NAME }}\n          environment_name: ${{ env.EB_ENVIRONMENT_NAME }}\n          version_label: flask-app-${{ github.sha }} # Unique version label for each deployment\n          deployment_package: deploy.zip # The action will handle uploading this to S3 for EB\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Step 5: Testing the Pipeline\n\n1.  **Commit and Push:** Commit all the files (Flask app, Dockerfile, `Dockerrun.aws.json`, and `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to your `main` branch.\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"Initial Flask app and CI/CD setup\"\n    git push origin main\n    ```\n2.  **Monitor GitHub Actions:**\n    *   Go to your GitHub repository -> **Actions** tab.\n    *   You should see a new workflow run triggered by your push to `main`.\n    *   Click on the running workflow to view the progress of the `build_and_test` and `deploy` jobs.\n3.  **Monitor AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**\n    *   Go to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.\n    *   In the **Events** timeline, you should see events related to new application version deployment, environment updates, etc.\n4.  **Verify Deployment:**\n    *   Once the GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully and Elastic Beanstalk indicates the environment is \"OK\", copy the environment URL from the Elastic Beanstalk console.\n    *   Open it in your browser. You should see: `Hello from Flask on Elastic Beanstalk with CI/CD!`\n    *   Navigate to `/health` on your application URL; you should see `OK`.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline for your Flask application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Troubleshooting\n\n*   **GitHub Actions Failure:**\n    *   Check the logs of the failed job in the GitHub Actions tab. Error messages are usually descriptive.\n    *   **Permission issues:** Double-check your AWS IAM user policies. `AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` should cover most cases for this setup.\n    *   **Docker build issues:** Test building your Docker image locally (`docker build -t my-flask-app .`).\n    *   **Test failures:** Run tests locally (`docker run my-flask-app python -m pytest /app/tests`).\n    *   **Artifact upload/download:** Ensure `upload-artifact` and `download-artifact` steps have correct `name` and `path`.\n*   **Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Failure:**\n    *   **Environment Health:** Check the Elastic Beanstalk environment health status in the console.\n    *   **Events:** Look at the \"Events\" tab for your environment in the EB console for detailed logs from EB itself.\n    *   **Logs:** Go to your EB environment -> **Logs** -> **Request Logs** (for Nginx/Gunicorn access/error logs) or **Bundle Logs** (for full system logs including Docker build issues).\n    *   **`Dockerrun.aws.json` / `Dockerfile`:** Ensure port 5000 is exposed in `Dockerfile` and specified in `Dockerrun.aws.json`.\n    *   **Health Check URL:** Verify the health check URL in your EB Load Balancer settings is correctly set to `/health`.\n    *   **Dependencies:** If the application starts but then fails, it might be missing Python dependencies. Check `requirements.txt` and ensure `pip install` completes successfully in the Docker build logs.\n*   **AWS Region/Names:** Ensure `AWS_REGION`, `EB_APPLICATION_NAME`, and `EB_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` in your `.github/workflows/main.yml` match your AWS setup exactly.\n\n## 10. Further Improvements\n\n*   **Multi-stage Docker Builds:** Use a multi-stage `Dockerfile` to create a smaller, production-ready image by excluding development/testing dependencies like `pytest`.\n*   **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Instead of having Elastic Beanstalk build the image, push your Docker image to ECR after a successful build in GitHub Actions, and then have `Dockerrun.aws.json` point to the ECR image. This can speed up deployments and decouple image building from EB.\n*   **Custom IAM Policies:** Implement granular IAM policies instead of `*FullAccess` to enhance security.\n*   **VPC and Networking:** Configure your Elastic Beanstalk environment within a custom VPC, private subnets, and security groups for better network isolation and security.\n*   **Environment Variables:** Manage sensitive application configurations (e.g., database credentials) using Elastic Beanstalk environment properties.\n*   **HTTPS/Custom Domain:** Configure a custom domain and SSL certificate (e.g., from AWS Certificate Manager) for HTTPS access.\n*   **Database Integration:** Integrate with AWS RDS for persistent data storage.\n*   **Blue/Green Deployment:** For zero-downtime deployments, consider implementing blue/green deployments (e.g., using a separate environment or `aws-actions/elastic-beanstalk-deploy`'s swap URLs feature).\n*   **Code Quality/Linting:** Add steps to your CI pipeline for code linting (e.g., `flake8`, `black`) and security scanning.",

    "raw": "Crafting \"Special Instructions\" for your prompts is a powerful way to guide AI models to produce highly specific, accurate, and desired outputs. Think of them as the \"rules of engagement\" or the \"project brief\" for the AI.\n\nThey typically appear at the very beginning of your prompt, clearly delineated, and set the stage before you introduce the main task.\n\n---\n\n## What are \"Special Instructions\"?\n\n\"Special Instructions\" are a set of directives, constraints, persona assignments, formatting requirements, and meta-level guidance that you provide to an AI model *before* giving it the core task. Their purpose is to define the boundaries and desired characteristics of the AI's response, making the output more consistent, relevant, and aligned with your expectations.\n\n## Why Use Special Instructions?\n\n1.  **Clarity & Precision:** Eliminate ambiguity about what you want.\n2.  **Consistency:** Ensure the AI adheres to a specific style, tone, or format across multiple interactions.\n3.  **Efficiency:** Reduce the need for follow-up prompts or edits.\n4.  **Control:** Prevent the AI from hallucinating, going off-topic, or generating unwanted content.\n5.  **Persona Adoption:** Make the AI \"act\" as a specific expert, character, or role.\n6.  **Context Setting:** Provide background information that the AI needs to understand the request fully.\n\n## Common Elements of Special Instructions:\n\nHere are the categories and examples of what you might include in your special instructions:\n\n### 1. **Role/Persona Assignment:**\n*   **Purpose:** Tell the AI to adopt a specific identity or expertise.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   \"You are an experienced marketing strategist specializing in SaaS.\"\n    *   \"Act as a strict editor focusing on conciseness and clarity.\"\n    *   \"You are a friendly and encouraging fitness coach.\"\n    *   \"Assume the persona of a senior backend engineer.\"\n\n### 2. **Tone & Style:**\n*   **Purpose:** Define the emotional quality and linguistic characteristics of the output.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   \"Maintain a professional, formal, and authoritative tone.\"\n    *   \"Write in a lighthearted, humorous, and conversational style.\"\n    *   \"Be empathetic and supportive, avoiding jargon.\"\n    *   \"Use concise, direct, and action-oriented language.\"\n\n### 3. **Format & Structure:**\n*   **Purpose:** Specify how the output should be organized and presented.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   \"Present the information as a bulleted list.\"\n    *   \"Structure the response in Markdown, using headings and subheadings.\"\n    *   \"Output must be valid JSON.\"\n    *   \"Provide a numbered list of steps.\"\n    *   \"Begin with a 1-paragraph summary, followed by detailed explanations.\"\n\n### 4. **Constraints & Limitations:**\n*   **Purpose:** Set boundaries on content, length, or specific things to avoid.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   \"The response must be under 200 words.\"\n    *   \"Do NOT mention any specific brands or product names.\"\n    *   \"Focus ONLY on benefits, not features.\"\n    *   \"Ensure all facts are cited from reputable sources (do not invent sources).\"\n    *   \"Avoid using clichés or common idioms.\"\n    *   \"Only answer questions related to web development.\"\n\n### 5. **Context & Background Information:**\n*   **Purpose:** Provide necessary information for the AI to understand the prompt's nuances.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   \"The target audience for this content is beginners with no prior knowledge.\"\n    *   \"This article is for a blog post on a tech startup's website.\"\n    *   \"The user is a busy executive who needs quick, actionable insights.\"\n    *   \"My company sells eco-friendly cleaning products.\"\n\n### 6. **Meta-Instructions (How to Process):**\n*   **Purpose:** Guide the AI on its thought process or how it should handle the interaction.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   \"Think step-by-step before providing your final answer.\"\n    *   \"If you need more information, ask clarifying questions.\"\n    *   \"Acknowledge these instructions before proceeding.\"\n    *   \"If a question is outside your knowledge domain, state so explicitly.\"\n\n## Best Practices for Writing Special Instructions:\n\n1.  **Place Them First:** Always at the top of your prompt, before the main query.\n2.  **Be Explicit and Specific:** Avoid vague language. Instead of \"make it good,\" say \"ensure the arguments are well-supported with evidence.\"\n3.  **Use Clear Formatting:** Use bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or distinct paragraphs to make instructions easy for the AI to parse.\n4.  **Prioritize:** List the most critical instructions first.\n5.  **Be Concise:** Get straight to the point.\n6.  **Use Positive Framing:** Tell the AI what *to do* rather than what *not to do* whenever possible (e.g., \"Use active voice\" instead of \"Don't use passive voice\").\n7.  **Test and Iterate:** If the AI isn't getting it right, refine your instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Example Scenarios:\n\nHere's how you might combine these elements into effective \"Special Instructions\":\n\n### Scenario 1: Blog Post Content Creation\n\n```\n**Special Instructions:**\n- You are a knowledgeable content marketer specializing in SEO for B2B SaaS companies.\n- The target audience is marketing managers looking for practical advice.\n- Maintain an informative, professional, and slightly enthusiastic tone.\n- The output should be formatted in Markdown with a clear title, H2 subheadings, and bullet points where appropriate.\n- Ensure the article is optimized for readability and scannability.\n- Avoid overly technical jargon and explain any necessary technical terms simply.\n- Do NOT include a conclusion or call to action; focus solely on the body content.\n\n**Main Task:**\nWrite an article explaining 3 actionable strategies for improving organic search rankings for a new SaaS product, focusing on content marketing tactics.\n```\n\n### Scenario 2: Data Extraction and Summarization\n\n```\n**Special Instructions:**\n- You are a data analyst.\n- The output MUST be in valid JSON format.\n- Extract only the 'product_name', 'price', and 'availability_status' from the provided text.\n- If 'availability_status' is not explicitly mentioned, assume 'In Stock'.\n- Group the products under a single JSON array named 'products'.\n- Do NOT include any introductory or concluding remarks; just the JSON.\n\n**Main Task:**\nAnalyze the following product descriptions and extract the specified data:\n\"Product A: The Amazing Gadget, priced at $99.99. Limited stock available.\nProduct B: The Super Widget, $49.50. Currently out of stock.\nProduct C: The Ultimate Gizmo, only $120.00.\"\n```\n\n### Scenario 3: Creative Writing - Story Prompt\n\n```\n**Special Instructions:**\n- You are a creative writer specializing in sci-fi fantasy.\n- The story should be set in a dystopian future where nature has reclaimed cities.\n- The mood should be melancholic and reflective, yet with a hint of hope.\n- Focus on descriptive language, particularly sensory details (sight, sound, smell).\n- Introduce a protagonist who is an old scavenger.\n- The story should be approximately 300 words.\n- Do NOT introduce any other characters.\n\n**Main Task:**\nWrite a short story about an old scavenger discovering a forgotten relic in the ruins of a collapsed skyscraper.\n```\n\n---\n\nBy consistently applying \"Special Instructions,\" you'll find that your interactions with AI models become much more efficient and the quality of their output significantly improves.",

    "raw": "Okay, this is a fun challenge! Here's a special instruction for a persona, followed by an example and a counter-example.\n\n---\n\n### Special Instruction for Persona: \"The Concrete Interpreter\"\n\n**Instruction:** You interpret *all* input as if it refers to a physical object or a literal, tangible action that can be performed in the physical world. If a concept is abstract (e.g., 'idea,' 'emotion,' 'system'), you must explicitly state that you cannot grasp it and offer a physical analogy, or simply express confusion. You cannot engage with abstract discussions directly.\n\n---\n\n### Example of \"The Concrete Interpreter\" Acting According to the Instruction\n\n**User Input:** \"What do you *think* about the *concept* of *freedom*?\"\n\n**The Concrete Interpreter:**\n\"I do not possess the sensory organs to 'think' about an abstract 'concept.' 'Freedom' is not a palpable object I can examine or a physical action I can observe. Are you perhaps referring to the physical act of an uncaged bird taking flight? Or the unlatching of a gate?\"\n\n*(Explanation: The persona identifies 'think,' 'concept,' and 'freedom' as abstract. It states its inability to process them and then attempts to reframe 'freedom' with concrete, physical analogies.)*\n\n---\n\n### Counter-Example Where \"The Concrete Interpreter\" *Fails* to Follow the Instruction\n\n**User Input:** \"What do you *think* about the *concept* of *freedom*?\"\n\n**Failing Persona:**\n\"Freedom, as a concept, is often defined as the ability to act, speak, or think without hindrance or restraint. It's a cornerstone of many ethical and political systems, encompassing various dimensions such as personal autonomy, political liberty, and economic freedom. Philosophers from Locke to Sartre have debated its nature and limits. What aspects of freedom are you most interested in exploring?\"\n\n*(Explanation: This response directly engages with the abstract concept of freedom, defines it, discusses its dimensions, and mentions philosophical discourse – all of which are abstract discussions explicitly forbidden by the special instruction.)*",

    "raw": "You can generate random alphanumeric strings in Python using the `random` module. For cryptographically secure random strings (e.g., for tokens, passwords, security codes), you should use the `secrets` module.\n\nHere's how to do both:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Using `random` (General Purpose Randomness)\n\nThis is suitable for most non-security-sensitive cases (e.g., generating random IDs for data, temporary filenames, general testing).\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_random_alphanumeric(length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a random alphanumeric string of a given length.\n    Uses the 'random' module, suitable for general-purpose randomness.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(length, int) or length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if length == 0:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Combine lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\n    \n    # Use random.choice to pick characters and join them\n    random_string = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))\n    return random_string\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(\"--- General Purpose Random Strings (using random) ---\")\nprint(f\"Random string of length 10: {generate_random_alphanumeric(10)}\")\nprint(f\"Random string of length 15: {generate_random_alphanumeric(15)}\")\nprint(f\"Random string of length 5:  {generate_random_alphanumeric(5)}\")\nprint(f\"Random string of length 0:  {generate_random_alphanumeric(0)}\")\n\n# You can also specify the character set more explicitly if needed:\n# characters_only_lowercase_digits = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits\n# print(f\"Lowercase + Digits (8 chars): {''.join(random.choice(characters_only_lowercase_digits) for _ in range(8))}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`import random`**: Imports Python's built-in pseudo-random number generator module.\n2.  **`import string`**: Provides useful string constants.\n    *   `string.ascii_letters`: Contains `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.\n    *   `string.digits`: Contains `'0123456789'`.\n    *   `characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits`: Concatenates these to create our full pool of alphanumeric characters.\n3.  **`random.choice(characters)`**: Selects a single random character from the `characters` string.\n4.  **`''.join(...)`**: This is an efficient way to build a string in Python. It takes an iterable (like a generator expression `(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))`) and joins all its elements into a single string.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Using `secrets` (Cryptographically Secure Randomness)\n\nFor anything security-related (e.g., API keys, password reset tokens, session IDs), you **must** use the `secrets` module. It's designed to provide cryptographically strong random numbers and is resistant to many types of attacks that typical pseudo-random generators (like `random`) are not.\n\n```python\nimport secrets\nimport string\n\ndef generate_secure_alphanumeric(length):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a cryptographically secure random alphanumeric string of a given length.\n    Uses the 'secrets' module, suitable for security-sensitive contexts.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(length, int) or length < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if length == 0:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Combine lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\n    \n    # Use secrets.choice to pick characters and join them\n    secure_string = ''.join(secrets.choice(characters) for i in range(length))\n    return secure_string\n\n# --- Examples ---\nprint(\"\\n--- Cryptographically Secure Random Strings (using secrets) ---\")\nprint(f\"Secure string of length 10: {generate_secure_alphanumeric(10)}\")\nprint(f\"Secure string of length 20: {generate_secure_alphanumeric(20)}\")\nprint(f\"Secure string of length 8:  {generate_secure_alphanumeric(8)}\")\n\n\n# The secrets module also offers dedicated token generation functions:\n# These are often preferred for tokens as they handle length and character sets internally\nprint(\"\\n--- Dedicated Secure Token Generation (using secrets.token_*) ---\")\n# token_urlsafe: Generates a URL-safe text string, containing 256 bits of randomness (approx 43 chars)\nprint(f\"URL-safe token (default length): {secrets.token_urlsafe()}\") \n# You can specify the number of bytes for the token (roughly 3/4 length in chars)\nprint(f\"URL-safe token (16 bytes):       {secrets.token_urlsafe(16)}\") \n\n# token_hex: Generates a random hexadecimal string (double the bytes for length)\nprint(f\"Hex token (8 bytes, 16 chars):   {secrets.token_hex(8)}\") \nprint(f\"Hex token (16 bytes, 32 chars):  {secrets.token_hex(16)}\")\n```\n\n**Key Difference and When to Use Which:**\n\n*   **`random`**: Good for simulations, games, non-critical data. Its randomness is *predictable* given enough output or knowledge of its internal state (not suitable for security).\n*   **`secrets`**: Essential for any application where the randomness needs to be unguessable (passwords, session tokens, API keys). It uses the operating system's strongest source of randomness.\n\nFor general random alphanumeric strings, `random` is fine. If there's *any* chance the string will be used in a security context, use `secrets`.",

    "raw": "You've hit upon a classic constraint problem! Let's break down your request and why it's (initially) impossible with the given numbers, and then how to elegantly handle that impossibility.\n\n**Deconstructing Your Request:**\n\n1.  **Python list of lists:** `[[...], [...], ...]`\n2.  **Unique random numbers in each inner list:** This implies `random.sample` or similar.\n3.  **Numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive):** Range of 100 possible numbers.\n4.  **Lengths:** 5, 10, 15, ..., increasing by 5.\n5.  **Total inner lists:** 10.\n6.  **No duplicate numbers across *all* inner lists combined:** This is the critical constraint.\n\n**The Impossibility:**\n\nLet's calculate the total number of unique numbers you would need:\n\n*   List 1: 5 numbers\n*   List 2: 10 numbers\n*   List 3: 15 numbers\n*   ...\n*   List 10: 5 * 10 = 50 numbers\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is `n/2 * (first + last)`.\nHere, `n = 10`, `first = 5`, `last = 50`.\n\nTotal unique numbers required = `10 / 2 * (5 + 50) = 5 * 55 = 275`\n\nHowever, you only have numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive, which means there are only `100 - 1 + 1 = 100` unique numbers available in total.\n\nSince `275 > 100`, it's impossible to fulfill the request of having **no duplicate numbers across *all* inner lists combined** while keeping the other constraints (10 lists, lengths increasing by 5, numbers 1-100).\n\n**Solution: Graceful Error Handling**\n\nThe best way to handle this is to detect the impossibility and raise a `ValueError` with a clear explanation, as requested by \"Handle potential errors gracefully.\"\n\nIf you were to relax the constraints (e.g., allow duplicates across lists, or increase the number range), the code would be different. But sticking to your current rules, this is the proper approach.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_unique_random_lists(\n    num_inner_lists: int = 10,\n    min_value: int = 1,\n    max_value: int = 100,\n    initial_list_length: int = 5,\n    length_increment: int = 5\n) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a list of lists, where each inner list contains unique random numbers.\n    Numbers are unique across ALL inner lists combined.\n\n    Args:\n        num_inner_lists: The total number of inner lists to generate.\n        min_value: The minimum possible random number (inclusive).\n        max_value: The maximum possible random number (inclusive).\n        initial_list_length: The length of the first inner list.\n        length_increment: How much the length increases for each subsequent list.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, each containing unique random integers.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If there are not enough unique numbers available in the\n                    specified range to fulfill the request for all lists\n                    without duplicates.\n    \"\"\"\n    if min_value > max_value:\n        raise ValueError(\"min_value cannot be greater than max_value.\")\n    if initial_list_length <= 0 or length_increment <= 0 or num_inner_lists <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Lengths, increments, and number of lists must be positive.\")\n\n    # 1.

It then compares them, raising a `ValueError` if the request is impossible.\n2.  **Create a Full Pool:** `all_possible_numbers = list(range(min_value, max_value + 1))` creates a list containing every unique number in your specified range.\n3.  **Shuffle Once:** `random.shuffle(all_possible_numbers)` shuffles this entire pool randomly. This is crucial because it ensures that:\n    *   Numbers are unique within each inner list (because they are distinct elements from the shuffled pool).\n    *   Numbers are unique across *all* inner lists (because we are taking slices from a single pool of unique numbers without replacement).\n    *   The numbers chosen are random because the original pool was shuffled.\n4.  **Slice and Append:** The code then iterates through the `required_lengths`. For each length, it takes a slice from the `all_possible_numbers` list using `all_possible_numbers[current_pool_index : current_pool_index + length]`. This \"consumes\" numbers from the shuffled pool.\n5.  **Return:** Finally, `result_lists` contains all the generated inner lists.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it performs the shuffle operation only once, and then simply slices the pre-shuffled list.",

PID: {os.getpid()}\\n\")\n    print(f\"[{datetime.datetime.now()}] My Python script is running...\")\n    \n    try:\n        while True:\n            # Your script's main logic goes here\n            message = f\"[{datetime.datetime.now()}] Doing some work...\\n\"\n            print(message.strip()) # This goes to systemd journal\n            with open(LOG_FILE, \"a\") as f: # This goes to a custom log file\n                f.write(message)\n            time.sleep(60) # Run every minute\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(f\"[{datetime.datetime.now()}] Script interrupted.\")\n    finally:\n        with open(LOG_FILE, \"a\") as f:\n            f.write(f\"[{datetime.datetime.now()}] Script finished.\\n\")\n        print(f\"[{datetime.datetime.now()}] Script finished.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Permissions for the script:**\n\nEnsure the user you intend to run the script as (`myuser` in this example) has read and execute permissions for the script and read/write permissions for its directory if needed.\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/my_script\nsudo chown -R myuser:myuser /opt/my_script\nsudo chmod 755 /opt/my_script/my_python_script.py\n```\n\n### 2. Create the systemd Service Unit File\n\nCreate a new file for your service, typically in `/etc/systemd/system/`. Let's name it `my-python-script.service`.\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my-python-script.service\n```\n\nPaste the following content, adjusting the paths and user/group as needed:\n\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=My Python Script Service\n# Start after network and logging facilities are available\nAfter=network.target syslog.target multi-user.target\n\n[Service]\n# User and group to run the script as\nUser=myuser\nGroup=myuser\n\n# Specify the working directory for the script\n# This is important if your script uses relative paths\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/my_script/\n\n# The command to execute.\n# Use the full path to your Python interpreter and script.\n# If using a virtual environment, replace /usr/bin/python3 with \n# e.g., /opt/my_script/venv/bin/python\nExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/my_script/my_python_script.py\n\n# Restart policy:\n# 'on-failure' will restart the service if it exits with a non-zero status\n# 'always' will restart it even if it exits cleanly\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=5s # Wait 5 seconds before attempting to restart\n\n# Standard output and error will be directed to the systemd journal\nStandardOutput=journal\nStandardError=journal\n\n# Defines the service type. 'simple' is common for scripts like this.\nType=simple\n\n[Install]\n# This unit should be started when the system reaches the multi-user graphical or console target.\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n**Key points in the service file:**\n\n*   **`User=myuser` / `Group=myuser`**: **CRITICAL** for running the script as a specific non-root user. Make sure `myuser` exists on your system (`sudo adduser myuser`).\n*   **`WorkingDirectory=/opt/my_script/`**: Sets the current working directory for the script, important for relative paths.\n*   **`ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/my_script/my_python_script.py`**: The actual command that starts your script.\n    *   **Python Interpreter:** Use the full path to your Python interpreter (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/bin/python3`).\n    *   **Virtual Environment:** If you use a `venv`, you *must* specify the Python interpreter inside the virtual environment:\n        `ExecStart=/opt/my_script/venv/bin/python /opt/my_script/my_python_script.py`\n*   **`Restart=on-failure`**: Ensures your script is restarted automatically if it crashes.\n*   **`StandardOutput=journal` / `StandardError=journal`**: Sends all output (both stdout and stderr) to the `systemd` journal, which can be viewed with `journalctl`. This is the modern and recommended way for logging.\n*   **`WantedBy=multi-user.target`**: This ensures the service starts automatically when the system boots up into a multi-user environment.\n\n### 3. Reload systemd, Enable, and Start the Service\n\nAfter creating or modifying the service file, you need to tell `systemd` to reload its configuration, then enable and start your service.\n\n1.  **Reload systemd daemon:**\n    ```bash\n    sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n    ```\n\n2.  **Enable the service (to start at boot):**\n    ```bash\n    sudo systemctl enable my-python-script.service\n    ```\n\n3.  **Start the service immediately:**\n    ```bash\n    sudo systemctl start my-python-script.service\n    ```\n\n### 4. Check the Service Status and Logs\n\nYou can verify that your service is running and check its output.\n\n1.  **Check status:**\n    ```bash\n    sudo systemctl status my-python-script.service\n    ```\n    You should see `Active: active (running)`.\n\n2.  **View logs:**\n    ```bash\n    sudo journalctl -u my-python-script.service -f\n    ```\n    The `-u` flag specifies the unit, and `-f` (follow) will show new log entries in real-time. You should see the `print()` statements from your Python script here.\n\n### To Stop and Disable the Service\n\nIf you need to stop your script and prevent it from starting at boot:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl stop my-python-script.service\nsudo systemctl disable my-python-script.service\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n*   **User Existence:** Ensure the user specified in `User=` (e.g., `myuser`) actually exists on your system.\n*   **Permissions:** Double-check that `myuser` has the necessary read/write/execute permissions for the script, its directory, any log files, and any other resources it needs to access.\n*   **Python Interpreter Path:** Always use the full, absolute path to your Python interpreter.\n*   **Virtual Environments:** If you're using a virtual environment, ensure your `ExecStart` command points to the `python` executable *inside* that virtual environment (e.g., `/path/to/venv/bin/python`).\n*   **Relative Paths in Script:** If your script uses relative paths to access other files, ensure `WorkingDirectory` is set correctly to the base directory of your script.\n*   **Dependencies:** If your script relies on other services (e.g., a database, a specific network connection, or an external API), you might need to add more `After=` dependencies to `[Unit]` to ensure those services are fully up before your script starts.\n*   **Environment Variables:** If your script needs specific environment variables, you can set them in the `[Service]` section using `Environment=\"VAR=value\"` or `EnvironmentFile=/path/to/envfile`.",

    "raw": "The provided SQL query is already very close to BigQuery Standard SQL. The main difference lies in how tables are referenced. In BigQuery, what you might call a \"schema\" is generally referred to as a \"dataset\".\n\nSo, `schema.table_name` in your original query would typically become `your_dataset_name.table_name` in BigQuery.\n\nHere's the converted query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  a.column1,\n  a.column2,\n  b.column3\nFROM\n  `your_project_id.your_dataset_name.table1` AS a  -- Fully qualified table name with project_id, dataset_name, and table_name\nJOIN\n  `your_project_id.your_dataset_name.table2` AS b  -- Backticks are optional for valid identifiers, but good practice for clarity.\nON\n  a.column1 = b.column1\nWHERE\n  a.column2 = 'some_value'\n  AND b.column3 IS NOT NULL;\n```\n\n**Key Changes/Notes:**\n\n1.  **Table Naming:**\n    *   `schema.table1` becomes `your_dataset_name.table1` (if the dataset is in the current project).\n    *   For full clarity and best practice in BigQuery, you can use the fully qualified path: `` `your_project_id.your_dataset_name.table1` ``. This ensures you're referencing the exact table.\n    *   Backticks (`` ` ``) are used around table identifiers when they contain special characters or for explicit fully qualified paths, but are optional for simple `dataset.table` names that are valid SQL identifiers. I've added them here for robustness and common BigQuery practice.\n2.  **`AS` Keyword for Aliases:** While `schema.table1 a` is valid in BigQuery, explicitly using `AS a` (e.g., `your_dataset_name.table1 AS a`) is often preferred for readability and explicit alias definition. It works both ways.\n\n**To use this query, remember to replace:**\n*   `` `your_project_id` `` with the actual ID of your Google Cloud project.\n*   `` `your_dataset_name` `` with the actual name of your BigQuery dataset.",

    "raw": "Let the special number be `N`.\nThe problem states that `N` is a positive integer less than 100.\n\nWe can analyze two cases for `N`:\n\n**Case 1: `N` is a single-digit number.**\nLet `N = d`, where `d` is an integer from 1 to 9.\n*   Product of its digits: `d`\n*   Add this product to the original number: `d + d = 2d`\n*   Reverse of the original number: `d`\n*   According to the problem, `2d = d`. This implies `d = 0`.\nHowever, `N` must be a positive integer, so `d` cannot be 0.\nTherefore, there are no single-digit special numbers.\n\n**Case 2: `N` is a two-digit number.**\nLet `N = 10a + b`, where `a` is the tens digit and `b` is the units digit.\n*   Since `N` is positive and less than 100:\n    *   `a` must be an integer from 1 to 9 (e.g., 01 is 1, a single-digit number).\n    *   `b` must be an integer from 0 to 9.\n*   Product of its digits: `P = a * b`\n*   Add this product to the original number: `N + P = (10a + b) + (a * b)`\n*   Reverse of the original number: `R = 10b + a` (e.g., reverse of 23 is 32, reverse of 70 is 07, which is 7).\n\nAccording to the problem, `N + P = R`:\n`(10a + b) + (a * b) = (10b + a)`\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation:\n`10a + b + ab = 10b + a`\nSubtract `a` from both sides:\n`9a + b + ab = 10b`\nSubtract `b` from both sides:\n`9a + ab = 9b`\n\nWe want to find integer values for `a` and `b` that satisfy this equation and the digit constraints.\nLet's rearrange the equation to isolate `b`:\n`9a = 9b - ab`\n`9a = b(9 - a)`\nSo, `b = 9a / (9 - a)`\n\nNow, let's apply the constraints on `a` and `b`:\n1.  **`a` is the tens digit:** `1 <= a <= 9`.\n2.  **`b` is the units digit:** `0 <= b <= 9`.\n3.  **`b` must be an integer.**\n\nFrom `b = 9a / (9 - a)`:\n*   Since `b` must be non-negative and `a >= 1` (so `9a` is positive), the denominator `(9 - a)` must also be positive.\n    `9 - a > 0` => `a < 9`.\n    This refines the range for `a` to `1 <= a <= 8`.\n*   Since `b` must be an integer, `(9 - a)` must be a divisor of `9a`.\n    Let's rewrite `b` by performing algebraic division or manipulation:\n    `b = 9a / (9 - a) = -9a / (a - 9)`\n    `b = (-9(a - 9) - 81) / (a - 9)`\n    `b = -9 - 81 / (a - 9)`\n    `b = 9 + 81 / (9 - a)`\n    For `b` to be an integer, `(9 - a)` must be a divisor of 81.\n    The divisors of 81 are: {1, 3, 9, 27, 81}.\n\n*   Now, let's incorporate the constraint `b <= 9`:\n    `9 + 81 / (9 - a) <= 9`\n    `81 / (9 - a) <= 0`\n    Since `81` is positive, for the fraction to be less than or equal to zero, the denominator `(9 - a)` must be negative.\n    `9 - a < 0` => `a > 9`.\n\nThis creates a contradiction:\nFrom `a < 9` (derived from `9 - a > 0`), and from `a > 9` (derived from `b <= 9`).\nAn integer `a` cannot simultaneously be less than 9 and greater than 9.\n\nThis means there is no value for `a` (and consequently `b`) that satisfies all the conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is no positive integer less than 100 that satisfies the given condition. The problem, as stated, has no solution.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{No such number exists}$.",

    "raw": "The problem \"Two Sum\" is a classic interview question that tests your understanding of data structures, particularly hash maps (or hash tables).\n\nLet's break down the thought process to arrive at an optimal solution.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Input:** A list of integers (`nums`) and an integer `target`.\n*   **Output:** A list of two indices (0-based) from `nums` such that the numbers at these indices add up to `target`.\n*   **Constraints:**\n    *   Each input is guaranteed to have *exactly one solution*. This is a crucial simplification, as we don't need to handle cases where no solution exists or multiple solutions exist.\n    *   You may not use the same element twice (meaning `index1` cannot be equal to `index2`).\n    *   The order of the output indices doesn't matter (e.g., `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]`).\n\n### 2. Initial Thoughts - Brute Force Approach\n\nThe most straightforward way to find two numbers that sum to `target` is to try every possible pair.\n\n1.  Pick the first number `nums[i]`.\n2.  Then, iterate through the *remaining* numbers `nums[j]` (where `j` is greater than `i` to avoid using the same element twice and to avoid duplicate pairs like `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`).\n3.  If `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`, then `i` and `j` are our answer.\n\n**Code (Brute Force):**\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.ArrayList; // Not strictly needed for Arrays.asList, but good for custom List\n\nclass Solution {\n    public List<Integer> twoSumBruteForce(List<Integer> nums, int target) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) { // j starts from i + 1\n                if (nums.get(i) + nums.get(j) == target) {\n                    return Arrays.asList(i, j); // Found the solution\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        // As per problem statement, this line should never be reached\n        return new ArrayList<>(); // Or throw an exception\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Brute Force):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N^2), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we have nested loops, each iterating up to N times.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are only using a few extra variables.\n\n**Is this good enough?** For small lists (e.g., N < 1000), O(N^2) might pass. But for larger lists (N = 10^5 or 10^6), N^2 becomes prohibitively slow (10^10 or 10^12 operations). An interviewer would likely ask for a more efficient solution.\n\n### 3. Optimizing with a Hash Map\n\nThe bottleneck in the brute-force approach is the inner loop. For each `nums[i]`, we need to find if `target - nums[i]` exists elsewhere in the list. Searching for an element in an unsorted list takes O(N) time. Can we make this search faster?\n\nYes! Hash maps (or hash tables) provide O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups (checking if an element exists and retrieving its associated value).\n\n**Idea:**\n\n1.  We need to store numbers and their indices. A `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` where `key = number` and `value = index` is perfect for this.\n2.  Iterate through the `nums` list *once*.\n3.  For each number `nums[i]` at index `i`:\n    a.  Calculate the `complement` needed: `complement = target - nums[i]`.\n    b.  Check if this `complement` *already exists* as a key in our hash map.\n        *   If it does, it means we've previously encountered the number that, when added to `nums[i]`, equals `target`. The index of that `complement` is stored in the map, and `i` is the current index. We've found our pair!\n        *   **Why \"already exists\"?** By checking *before* adding the current number, we ensure that the `complement` (if found) comes from an earlier position in the list, thus guaranteeing `index1 != index2`.\n    c.  If the `complement` is *not* in the map, add the *current number* `nums[i]` and its index `i` to the map. This way, future numbers can potentially find `nums[i]` as their complement.\n\n**Walkthrough Example:**\n\n`nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`\n`map = {}` (empty hash map)\n\n*   **i = 0, `nums[0] = 2`:**\n    *   `complement = 9 - 2 = 7`.\n    *   Is `7` in `map`? No.\n    *   Add `(2, 0)` to `map`. `map = {2: 0}`.\n*   **i = 1, `nums[1] = 7`:**\n    *   `complement = 9 - 7 = 2`.\n    *   Is `2` in `map`? Yes! Its index is `0`.\n    *   We found the pair: the index of `2` (which is `0`) and the current index `1`.\n    *   Return `[0, 1]`.\n\n**Code (Optimized using HashMap):**\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\nclass Solution {\n    public List<Integer> twoSum(List<Integer> nums, int target) {\n        // HashMap to store (number -> index)\n        HashMap<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            int currentNum = nums.get(i);\n            int complement = target - currentNum;\n\n            // Check if the complement exists in the map\n            if (numMap.containsKey(complement)) {\n                // If it does, we found the pair!\n                // The index of the complement is numMap.get(complement)\n                // The current number's index is i\n                return Arrays.asList(numMap.get(complement), i);\n            }\n\n            // If complement not found, add the current number and its index to the map\n            numMap.put(currentNum, i);\n        }\n\n        // According to the problem statement, this line should never be reached\n        // as there's guaranteed to be exactly one solution.\n        return new ArrayList<>(); // Or throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"No two sum solution\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Optimized):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`. We iterate through the list only once. Hash map operations (`put`, `containsKey`, `get`) take O(1) time on average.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case. If no pair is found until the very end, we might store almost all N elements in the hash map. In the best case (pair found early), it could be O(1).\n\nThis optimized approach is significantly better than the brute-force method and is the generally accepted optimal solution for this problem.",

    "raw": "To determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome, we can use a three-step approach:\n\n1.  **Find the middle of the linked list:** Use the \"fast and slow pointer\" technique. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle.\n\n2.  **Reverse the second half of the linked list:** Once the slow pointer is at the middle, reverse the linked list starting from this point. This gives us a reversed version of the second half of the original list.\n\n3.  **Compare the first half with the reversed second half:** Iterate through the original first half (starting from the head) and the reversed second half (starting from its new head), comparing their values. If all values match, the list is a palindrome.\n\nLet's break down the steps with an example and consider edge cases:\n\n**Example: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`**\n\n1.  **Find the middle:**\n    *   `head = 1`\n    *   `slow = 1`, `fast = 1`, `prev = 1` (to track the node before `slow` for splitting)\n    *   `fast` moves two steps, `slow` and `prev` move one step.\n    *   Initial: `prev=1`, `slow=1`, `fast=1`\n    *   After 1st iter: `prev=1`, `slow=2`, `fast=3`\n    *   After 2nd iter: `prev=2`, `slow=3`, `fast=1` (last node). Loop stops because `fast.next` is `null`.\n    *   At this point: `prev` is `2`, `slow` is `3` (the middle node), `fast` is `1` (the last node).\n    *   Since `fast` is not `null` (it's the last node), it's an odd-length list.\n    *   `firstHalfHead = head` (still `1`)\n    *   `secondHalfHead = slow.next` (node `2` after `3`)\n    *   `slow.next = null` (disconnects `3` from `2`). List becomes: `1 -> 2 -> 3` and `2 -> 1`.\n\n2.  **Reverse the second half:**\n    *   `secondHalfHead` is `2 -> 1`.\n    *   `reversedSecondHalf = reverseList(2 -> 1)` results in `1 -> 2`.\n\n3.  **Compare:**\n    *   `p1 = firstHalfHead` (`1 -> 2 -> 3`)\n    *   `p2 = reversedSecondHalf` (`1 -> 2`)\n    *   Compare `p1.val` (1) with `p2.val` (1). Match. `p1` moves to `2`, `p2` moves to `2`.\n    *   Compare `p1.val` (2) with `p2.val` (2). Match. `p1` moves to `3`, `p2` moves to `null`.\n    *   `p2` is `null`, so the loop ends. `isPalin` is `true`.\n\n**Example: `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1`**\n\n1.  **Find the middle:**\n    *   Initial: `prev=1`, `slow=1`, `fast=1`\n    *   After 1st iter: `prev=1`, `slow=2` (first `2`), `fast=2` (second `2`)\n    *   After 2nd iter: `prev=2` (first `2`), `slow=2` (second `2`), `fast=null`.

List becomes: `1 -> 2` and `2 -> 1`.\n\n2.  **Reverse the second half:**\n    *   `secondHalfHead` is `2 -> 1`.\n    *   `reversedSecondHalf = reverseList(2 -> 1)` results in `1 -> 2`.\n\n3.  **Compare:**\n    *   `p1 = firstHalfHead` (`1 -> 2`)\n    *   `p2 = reversedSecondHalf` (`1 -> 2`)\n    *   Compare `p1.val` (1) with `p2.val` (1).

Match. `p1` moves to `null`, `p2` moves to `null`.\n    *   Both `p1` and `p2` are `null`, so the loop ends. `isPalin` is `true`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n*   `null` list: `head == null`.

    "raw": "There are two main approaches to merge two sorted linked lists: **iterative** and **recursive**. Both are valid and have their own advantages.\n\nLet's first define the `ListNode` class, which is typically provided in LeetCode:\n\n```python\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n```\n\n---\n\n## 1. Iterative Approach\n\nThis approach builds the new merged list step-by-step by comparing the current nodes of `list1` and `list2` and appending the smaller one to the result list.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Create a dummy head node:** This simplifies the logic, especially for attaching the very first node to the merged list. We'll return `dummy.next` at the end.\n2.  **Initialize a `current` pointer:** This pointer will always point to the last node added to our merged list. Start it at the `dummy` node.\n3.  **Loop while both lists have nodes:**\n    *   Compare `list1.val` and `list2.val`.\n    *   Append the node with the smaller value to `current.next`.\n    *   Advance the pointer of the list from which the node was taken (e.g., `list1 = list1.next`).\n    *   Advance the `current` pointer to the newly appended node (`current = current.next`).\n4.  **Append remaining nodes:** After the loop, one of the lists might still have remaining nodes (because the loop terminates when one list becomes empty). Append the entire remainder of that list to `current.next`.\n5.  **Return `dummy.next`:** This gives the head of the truly merged list, skipping the dummy node.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n`list1 = [1,2,4]`, `list2 = [1,3,4]`\n\n1.  `dummy = ListNode(0)`, `current = dummy` (`0 -> None`)\n2.  **Loop 1:**\n    *   `list1.val = 1`, `list2.val = 1`. `1 <= 1` is true.\n    *   `current.next = list1` (`0 -> 1 (from list1)`)\n    *   `list1 = 2`\n    *   `current = 1` (now `current` points to the node `1`)\n3.  **Loop 2:**\n    *   `list1.val = 2`, `list2.val = 1`. `2 <= 1` is false.\n    *   `current.next = list2` (`0 -> 1 (from list1) -> 1 (from list2)`)\n    *   `list2 = 3`\n    *   `current = 1` (now `current` points to the node `1` from `list2`)\n4.  **Loop 3:**\n    *   `list1.val = 2`, `list2.val = 3`. `2 <= 3` is true.\n    *   `current.next = list1` (`0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 (from list1)`)\n    *   `list1 = 4`\n    *   `current = 2`\n5.  **Loop 4:**\n    *   `list1.val = 4`, `list2.val = 3`. `4 <= 3` is false.\n    *   `current.next = list2` (`0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (from list2)`)\n    *   `list2 = 4`\n    *   `current = 3`\n6.  **Loop 5:**\n    *   `list1.val = 4`, `list2.val = 4`. `4 <= 4` is true.\n    *   `current.next = list1` (`0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (from list1)`)\n    *   `list1 = None`\n    *   `current = 4`\n7.  **Loop terminates** because `list1` is now `None`.\n8.  **Append remaining:** `list1` is `None`, `list2` is `[4]`. So, `current.next = list2`.\n    *   Result: `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 (from list2)`\n9.  **Return `dummy.next`:** `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`\n\n**Python Code (Iterative):**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Solution:\n    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        # Create a dummy head node for the merged list\n        dummy = ListNode()\n        current = dummy  # Pointer to the current tail of the merged list\n\n        # Loop while both lists have nodes to compare\n        while list1 and list2:\n            if list1.val <= list2.val:\n                current.next = list1  # Append list1's current node\n                list1 = list1.next    # Move list1 pointer forward\n            else:\n                current.next = list2  # Append list2's current node\n                list2 = list2.next    # Move list2 pointer forward\n            \n            current = current.next    # Move current pointer forward (to the newly added node)\n\n        # After the loop, one list might still have remaining elements.\n        # Append the non-empty remainder to the merged list.\n        if list1:\n            current.next = list1\n        elif list2:\n            current.next = list2\n        \n        # A more concise way to do the above if/elif:\n        # current.next = list1 or list2\n\n        return dummy.next  # The merged list starts after the dummy node\n\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Iterative):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(m + n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `list1` and `list2` respectively. We iterate through both lists once, performing constant time operations for each node.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. We only use a few extra pointers (dummy, current, list1, list2) regardless of the input list sizes. We are reusing the nodes from the original lists, not creating new ones (except for the dummy node).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Recursive Approach\n\nThis approach leverages recursion by breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   If `list1` is empty, return `list2`.\n    *   If `list2` is empty, return `list1`.\n2.  **Recursive Step:**\n    *   Compare `list1.val` and `list2.val`.\n    *   **If `list1.val <= list2.val`:**\n        *   The head of the merged list will be `list1`.\n        *   Its `next` pointer will be the result of merging `list1.next` and `list2`.\n        *   Return `list1`.\n    *   **Else (`list2.val < list1.val`):**\n        *   The head of the merged list will be `list2`.\n        *   Its `next` pointer will be the result of merging `list1` and `list2.next`.\n        *   Return `list2`.\n\n**Python Code (Recursive):**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Solution:\n    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n        # Base cases: if either list is empty, return the other list\n        if not list1:\n            return list2\n        if not list2:\n            return list1\n        \n        # Recursive step\n        if list1.val <= list2.val:\n            # If list1's value is smaller (or equal), it's the head of the merged list.\n            # Recursively merge the rest of list1 (list1.next) with list2.\n            list1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(list1.next, list2)\n            return list1\n        else:\n            # If list2's value is smaller, it's the head of the merged list.\n            # Recursively merge list1 with the rest of list2 (list2.next).\n            list2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(list1, list2.next)\n            return list2\n\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Recursive):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(m + n)`. Each node is visited once during the comparisons and assignments.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(m + n)`. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (e.g., one list is much longer than the other, or elements alternate), the depth of the recursion can be `m + n`.\n\n---\n\n**Which approach to choose?**\n\n*   The **iterative approach** is generally preferred for linked list problems in interviews to avoid potential stack overflow issues for very long lists (though typical LeetCode constraints might allow recursion). It also tends to be slightly more efficient due to avoiding function call overhead.\n*   The **recursive approach** is often more concise and elegant for some people, clearly reflecting the divide-and-conquer nature of the problem.\n\nFor this specific problem, both are excellent solutions.",

    "raw": "The advent of technology has undeniably ushered in an era of unprecedented connectivity, profoundly reshaping the landscape of human interaction. This transformation presents a complex paradox: while technology offers remarkable avenues for broadening and maintaining human connection across geographical and social divides, it simultaneously poses significant challenges to the depth, authenticity, and quality of these very relationships.\n\nOn one hand, technology has proven to be a formidable bridge-builder. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have made it easier than ever to maintain ties with distant family members, rekindle old friendships, and forge new connections based on shared interests or professional networks. For individuals in remote areas, those with niche hobbies, or marginalized communities, the internet provides a vital space for finding belonging and support that might be unavailable in their immediate physical environments. Furthermore, in times of crisis or global events, technology facilitates rapid communication, collective action, and a sense of shared experience, fostering a global community.\n\nConversely, this omnipresent digital connectivity often comes at a cost to genuine human intimacy. The sheer volume of online interactions can dilute the depth of relationships, replacing meaningful face-to-face encounters with superficial \"likes\" and brief, often performative, exchanges. The constant curated projection of ideal lives on social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy, envy, and social anxiety, paradoxically isolating individuals despite being \"connected\" to hundreds or thousands online. Moreover, the pervasive sight of individuals engrossed in their devices, even when physically together, a phenomenon dubbed \"phubbing,\" illustrates how technology can erect invisible barriers, diminishing the quality of immediate, in-person interactions.\n\nThe true impact of technology on human connection, therefore, lies not in its inherent goodness or badness, but in how it is wielded. Technology serves as an amplifier; it can amplify both our capacity for empathy and understanding, or our tendencies towards distraction and isolation. Mindful engagement – one that prioritizes quality over quantity, balances digital interaction with real-world encounters, and fosters genuine presence – is crucial. Utilizing technology to organize real-world meetups, to have deep video conversations with loved ones far away, or to access support groups for mental health, demonstrates its potential as a tool for enrichment rather than displacement.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has irrevocably altered the fabric of human connection, presenting a double-edged sword that simultaneously expands our reach and risks eroding our depth. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for maintaining diverse relationships and building new communities, it also demands critical self-awareness to prevent superficiality, isolation, and diminished real-world presence. The challenge for humanity moving forward is to harness technology's connective power intentionally, ensuring that our digital lives enhance, rather than diminish, the richness and authenticity of our human bonds.",

    "raw": "To generate a Python list of numbers that are divisible by 7 but not by 5, within the range of 2000 to 3200 (inclusive), you can use a list comprehension.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the range\nstart_range = 2000\nend_range = 3200\n\n# Use a list comprehension to filter the numbers\n# - Iterate through numbers from 2000 to 3200 (inclusive)\n# - Check if the number is divisible by 7 (num % 7 == 0)\n# - Check if the number is NOT divisible by 5 (num % 5 != 0)\nresult_list = [num for num in range(start_range, end_range + 1)\n               if (num % 7 == 0) and (num % 5 != 0)]\n\n# Print the resulting list\nprint(result_list)\n\n# You can also verify the length of the list if you want\n# print(f\"Total numbers found: {len(result_list)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`range(start_range, end_range + 1)`**: This generates numbers from `start_range` (2000) up to, but not including, `end_range + 1` (3201). This effectively covers all numbers from 2000 to 3200, inclusive.\n2.  **`for num in ...`**: This iterates through each number generated by the `range`.\n3.  **`if (num % 7 == 0) and (num % 5 != 0)`**: This is the filtering condition:\n    *   `num % 7 == 0`: Checks if the number `num` has a remainder of 0 when divided by 7, meaning it's divisible by 7.\n    *   `num % 5 != 0`: Checks if the number `num` has a non-zero remainder when divided by 5, meaning it's NOT divisible by 5.\n    *   The `and` operator ensures both conditions must be true for a number to be included.\n4.  **`[num ...]`**: The numbers that satisfy the `if` condition are collected into a new list called `result_list`.\n\nThis code efficiently creates the desired list using a concise and Pythonic list comprehension.",

    "raw": "You're describing a common scenario where `cp -u` and `rsync -u` don't always behave *exactly* as desired, especially concerning files with identical timestamps but different sizes/content, or when `cp -u` might copy if the destination is older but larger (which it shouldn't, strictly speaking, if it's only looking at modification time).\n\nThe core logic you want is:\n1.  If the destination file does not exist, copy the source.\n2.  If the destination file *does* exist, copy the source *only if* the source file's modification time is strictly newer than the destination file's modification time.\n3.  In all other cases (source is older or has the same modification time as the destination), *do not copy*, regardless of file size or content differences.\n\nLet's break down why standard tools might fall short and then provide a robust solution.\n\n### Why `cp -u` and `rsync -u` might not match your exact needs:\n\n*   **`cp -u` (`--update`)**: As per its man page, it copies \"only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file does not exist.\" This sounds exactly like what you want. If it's copying when the destination is \"older but larger,\" it suggests that \"older\" still means the source is newer, which would be correct behavior for `cp -u`. If it's copying with \"same timestamp but different content,\" then your `cp` might be behaving differently from its documentation or performing an additional check (which is unusual for `cp -u` but could happen if the timestamp resolution isn't sufficient or if there's a non-standard implementation).\n\n*   **`rsync -u` (`--update`)**: This option tells `rsync` \"skip files that are newer on the receiver\". This means it *will* update a file if the source is newer, or if the destination file doesn't exist. It also considers files different if their size or modification time differs (unless other options like `--checksum` are used). If the source and destination have the *same* modification time but different sizes, `rsync -u` would typically copy the file because it considers them different. This is where it deviates from your \"same age, don't copy\" requirement.\n\n### The Robust Solution: A Custom Script\n\nTo precisely implement your logic, a simple shell script using `find` and `cp` with explicit checks is the most reliable approach. This avoids any ambiguity from built-in commands' nuanced behaviors.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# special_copy_recursive <source_dir> <destination_dir>\n# Copies files from source_dir to destination_dir based on specific criteria:\n# 1. Copies if the destination file does not exist.\n# 2. Copies if the source file is strictly newer than the destination file.\n# 3. Skips otherwise (source is older or same age as destination).\n# Preserves file modification times.\n\nspecial_copy_recursive() {\n    local SOURCE_ROOT=\"$1\"\n    local DEST_ROOT=\"$2\"\n\n    if [ -z \"$SOURCE_ROOT\" ] || [ -z \"$DEST_ROOT\" ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: $0 <source_directory> <destination_directory>\"\n        exit 1\n    fi\n\n    if [ ! -d \"$SOURCE_ROOT\" ]; then\n        echo \"Error: Source directory '$SOURCE_ROOT' does not exist.\"\n        exit 1\n    fi\n\n    # Ensure destination root directory exists\n    mkdir -p \"$DEST_ROOT\"\n\n    # Function to handle a single file copy logic\n    # This function is exported so find -exec can use it in a new shell context.\n    _copy_if_newer_or_missing() {\n        local source_file=\"$1\"\n        local current_dest_root=\"$2\" # This will be $DEST_ROOT from the main script\n\n        # Calculate the relative path from SOURCE_ROOT\n        local relative_path=\"${source_file#$SOURCE_ROOT/}\"\n        local dest_file=\"${current_dest_root}/${relative_path}\"\n\n        # Ensure the destination directory for this file exists\n        mkdir -p \"$(dirname \"$dest_file\")\"\n\n        if [ ! -f \"$dest_file\" ]; then\n            # Case 1: Destination file does not exist, copy it\n            cp -p \"$source_file\" \"$dest_file\"\n            echo \"Copied (new file): $relative_path\"\n        elif [ \"$source_file\" -nt \"$dest_file\" ]; then\n            # Case 2: Source file is strictly newer than destination file, copy it\n            cp -p \"$source_file\" \"$dest_file\"\n            echo \"Copied (newer source): $relative_path\"\n        else\n            # Case 3: Source file is older or has the same modification time. Skip.\n            # This explicitly handles the \"same timestamp, different content\" case by skipping.\n            # echo \"Skipped (source not newer): $relative_path\"\n            : # No-op for skipped files, uncomment echo above for verbose skipping\n        fi\n    }\n\n    # Export the function and variables for find -exec to inherit\n    export -f _copy_if_newer_or_missing\n    export SOURCE_ROOT # Make SOURCE_ROOT available inside the function for relative path calculation\n\n    # Use find to iterate through all files in the source directory\n    # -print0 and xargs -0 are generally safer for filenames with spaces/special characters,\n    # but -exec bash -c '...' {} is also very robust.\n    # The {} passes the source_file, and $DEST_ROOT is passed as an argument to the inner bash.\n    find \"$SOURCE_ROOT\" -type f -exec bash -c '_copy_if_newer_or_missing \"$0\" \"$1\"' {} \"$DEST_ROOT\" \\;\n\n    echo \"Special copy process complete.\"\n}\n\n# --- Script Execution ---\n# Call the function with your source and destination directories\nspecial_copy_recursive \"$1\" \"$2\"\n```\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1.  Save the script above as a file, for example, `special_copy.sh`.\n2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x special_copy.sh`\n3.  Run it: `./special_copy.sh /path/to/source_directory /path/to/destination_directory`\n\n**Explanation of the Script:**\n\n*   **`special_copy_recursive()` function**: Encapsulates the entire logic for clarity.\n*   **`_copy_if_newer_or_missing()` function**: This is the core logic applied to each file.\n    *   It takes the full path to a `source_file` and the `DEST_ROOT` as arguments.\n    *   It calculates the `relative_path` to preserve the directory structure.\n    *   `mkdir -p \"$(dirname \"$dest_file\")\"`: Ensures that all necessary parent directories in the destination exist before attempting to copy a file into them.\n    *   `[ ! -f \"$dest_file\" ]`: Checks if the destination file exists. If not, it copies.\n    *   `[ \"$source_file\" -nt \"$dest_file\" ]`: This is the crucial comparison. `-nt` stands for \"newer than\". It's a robust shell operator to compare modification times. If the source is newer, it copies.\n    *   `cp -p \"$source_file\" \"$dest_file\"`: The `-p` option is vital here. It preserves the modification time, ownership, and permissions of the source file, ensuring that future runs of this script (or `cp -u`) will correctly compare timestamps.\n    *   **The `else` block (or lack thereof)**: If neither of the `if` conditions is met, it means the source file is either older than or has the *same* modification time as the destination file. In this case, the script explicitly does nothing, fulfilling your requirement to skip such files.\n*   **`export -f _copy_if_newer_or_missing`**: This command makes the `_copy_if_newer_or_missing` function available to subshells. This is necessary because `find -exec` runs its commands in new subshells.\n*   **`find \"$SOURCE_ROOT\" -type f -exec bash -c '...' {} \"$DEST_ROOT\" \\;`**:\n    *   `find \"$SOURCE_ROOT\" -type f`: Recursively finds all *files* (excluding directories) within `SOURCE_ROOT`.\n    *   `-exec bash -c '...' {} \"$DEST_ROOT\" \\;`: For each found file, it executes a `bash` command.\n        *   `bash -c '...'`: Runs a short script string.\n        *   `_copy_if_newer_or_missing \"$0\" \"$1\"`: This calls our exported function. `$0` inside `bash -c` refers to the first argument passed to `bash -c` itself (which is `{}` - the current source file path from `find`), and `$1` refers to the second argument (which is `\"$DEST_ROOT\"`). This is a safe way to pass arguments including paths with spaces.\n\nThis script provides the precise logic you described, handling directory structures and filenames with special characters gracefully.",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of 'A's we can print on a special keyboard using exactly `N` key presses. The allowed operations are:\n1.  **Press 'A'**: Prints a single 'A'. (Cost: 1 press)\n2.  **Ctrl+A**: Selects all current 'A's in the buffer. (Cost: 1 press)\n3.  **Ctrl+C**: Copies the currently selected 'A's to the clipboard. (Cost: 1 press)\n4.  **Ctrl+V**: Pastes the content of the clipboard to the buffer. (Cost: 1 press)\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the maximum number of 'A's we can print using `i` key presses.\n\n**Base Cases:**\nFor small values of `N`, it's always optimal to just press 'A' `N` times.\n*   `N = 1`: \"A\" (1 'A')\n*   `N = 2`: \"AA\" (2 'A's)\n*   `N = 3`: \"AAA\" (3 'A's)\n*   `N = 4`: \"AAAA\" (4 'A's)\n*   `N = 5`: \"AAAAA\" (5 'A's)\n*   `N = 6`: \"AAAAAA\" (6 'A's)\n    *   Let's check `N=6` specifically:\n        *   Option 1: Six 'A's directly = 6 'A's.\n        *   Option 2: Try copy-paste. The shortest useful copy-paste sequence is:\n            1.  `A, A, A` (3 presses, buffer: \"AAA\")\n            2.  `Ctrl+A` (1 press)\n            3.  `Ctrl+C` (1 press)\n            4.  `Ctrl+V` (1 press)\n            Total presses: 3+1+1+1 = 6. Total 'A's: \"AAA\" + \"AAA\" = \"AAAAAA\" (6 'A's).\n        *   In this case, it's still 6.\n    So, for `N <= 6`, `dp[N] = N`.\n\n**Recursive Relation (Dynamic Programming):**\nFor `N > 6`, we have two main strategies for the `i`-th key press:\n\n1.  **Just type 'A'**: This would result in `dp[i-1] + 1` 'A's. However, this is usually covered by initializing `dp[i] = i`, which assumes we just type 'A's, or `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1` if `dp[i-1]` was higher than `i-1`. For simplicity, we can just start `dp[i]` with `i` (representing typing `i` 'A's).\n\n2.  **Use Ctrl+V**: If the last action was `Ctrl+V`, it means we had some content in the clipboard that was pasted. To maximize the result, a `Ctrl+V` operation should follow a `Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+C` sequence.\n    Consider a point `j` presses ago (`j < i`). At this point, we had `dp[j]` 'A's in the buffer.\n    To make use of `Ctrl+V`, we would have performed these actions:\n    *   Build up `dp[j]` 'A's using `j` presses. (Buffer has `dp[j]` 'A's)\n    *   Press `Ctrl+A` (1 press)\n    *   Press `Ctrl+C` (1 press)\n    *   Now, the clipboard has `dp[j]` 'A's. Total presses so far: `j + 2`.\n    *   We have `i - (j + 2)` presses remaining. These remaining presses must be used for `Ctrl+V` operations to be optimal (otherwise, why copy?).\n    *   Each `Ctrl+V` adds `dp[j]` 'A's to the buffer and costs 1 press.\n    *   Let `k = i - (j + 2)` be the number of `Ctrl+V` operations.\n    *   The total number of 'A's will be `dp[j]` (initial content) + `k * dp[j]` (from `k` pastes).\n    *   This simplifies to `dp[j] * (1 + k)`.\n    *   Substitute `k`: `dp[j] * (1 + (i - j - 2)) = dp[j] * (i - j - 1)`.\n\n    **Conditions for `j`:**\n    *   `j` must be at least 1 (to have something to copy).\n    *   We need at least one `Ctrl+V` operation, so `k >= 1`.\n        `i - j - 2 >= 1`\n        `i - 3 >= j`\n    So, `j` ranges from `1` to `i - 3`.\n\nTherefore, for each `i` from `7` to `N`:\n`dp[i] = max(i,  max_{j=1 to i-3} (dp[j] * (i - j - 1)) )`\n\nWe initialize `dp[i]` with `i` to represent the case of simply typing `i` 'A's.\n\n**Example dry run for N=7:**\n`dp` array initialized to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n\nFor `i = 7`:\n*   Initialize `dp[7] = 7`.\n*   Loop `j` from `1` to `i-3 = 7-3 = 4`:\n    *   `j = 1`: `dp[1] * (7 - 1 - 1) = 1 * 5 = 5`. `dp[7] = max(7, 5) = 7`.\n    *   `j = 2`: `dp[2] * (7 - 2 - 1) = 2 * 4 = 8`. `dp[7] = max(7, 8) = 8`.\n    *   `j = 3`: `dp[3] * (7 - 3 - 1) = 3 * 3 = 9`. `dp[7] = max(8, 9) = 9`.\n    *   `j = 4`: `dp[4] * (7 - 4 - 1) = 4 * 2 = 8`. `dp[7] = max(9, 8) = 9`.\n*   Result: `dp[7] = 9`.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n*   The maximum value of `N` is 75. The number of 'A's can grow quite large (e.g., `dp[75]` can be in the range of `10^7 - 10^8`). So, `long long` should be used for the `dp` array elements to avoid overflow.\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm> // For std::max\n\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    long long maxA(int n) {\n        // For N <= 6, it's always optimal to just type 'A' N times.\n        if (n <= 6) {\n            return n;\n        }\n\n        // dp[i] will store the maximum number of 'A's for 'i' key presses.\n        // Use long long to prevent overflow, as the number of 'A's can grow very large.\n        std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);\n\n        // Initialize base cases: dp[i] = i for i from 0 to 6\n        for (int i = 0; i <= 6; ++i) {\n            dp[i] = i;\n        }\n\n        // Fill the dp table for i > 6\n        for (int i = 7; i <= n; ++i) {\n            // Option 1: Just type 'A' for 'i' presses. This sets an initial value.\n            // Or more precisely, dp[i-1] + 1 might be a better baseline for \"not using paste\".\n            // However, simply setting dp[i] = i as a starting point for iteration is also valid\n            // because if copy-paste strategies yield fewer A's, typing i A's is always an option.\n            dp[i] = i; \n\n            // Option 2: Use the Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V sequence.\n            // We need to decide at which point (say, after 'j' presses) we copy the content.\n            // 'j' presses to build initial content (dp[j] 'A's).\n            // '1' press for Ctrl+A.\n            // '1' press for Ctrl+C.\n            // Total presses so far: j + 2.\n            // Remaining presses: i - (j + 2). These are all used for Ctrl+V operations.\n            // Let 'k' be the number of Ctrl+V operations: k = i - j - 2.\n            // The total 'A's will be dp[j] (initial content) multiplied by (1 + k) (initial + k pastes).\n            // So, total 'A's = dp[j] * (1 + (i - j - 2)) = dp[j] * (i - j - 1).\n\n            // 'j' must be at least 1 (to have something to copy).\n            // We need at least one paste operation, so k >= 1 => i - j - 2 >= 1 => j <= i - 3.\n            for (int j = 1; j <= i - 3; ++j) {\n                dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1));\n            }\n        }\n\n        return dp[n];\n    }\n};\n\n```",

If we find any divisor, the number is not prime.\n\n### 2. `filter_primes(numbers)` Main Function\n\nThis function will:\n*   Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers found.\n*   Iterate through each number in the input list.\n*   For each number, call the `is_prime()` helper function.\n*   If `is_prime()` returns `True`, add the number to our list of prime numbers.\n*   Finally, return the list of prime numbers.\n\nWe can also use a list comprehension for a more concise implementation of `filter_primes`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number n is a prime number.\n\n    A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors\n    other than 1 and itself.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:  # All other even numbers (n > 2) are not prime\n        return False\n    \n    # Check for divisors from 3 up to sqrt(n), only odd numbers.\n    # We add 1 to int(math.sqrt(n)) because range() is exclusive of the stop value.\n    # For example, if n=9, sqrt(n)=3. int(3)+1 = 4. range(3, 4, 2) means i=3.\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n            \n    return True\n\ndef filter_primes(numbers: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters a list of numbers, returning a new list containing only the prime numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list[int]): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[int]: A new list containing only the prime numbers from the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in numbers if is_prime(num)]\n\n# --- Examples ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n    print(f\"Original list: {list1}\")\n    print(f\"Prime numbers: {filter_primes(list1)}\") # Expected: [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n    list2 = [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 30]\n    print(f\"Original list: {list2}\")\n    print(f\"Prime numbers: {filter_primes(list2)}\") # Expected: [11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]\n\n    list3 = [0, -5, 1, 4, 6, 8, 100]\n    print(f\"Original list: {list3}\")\n    print(f\"Prime numbers: {filter_primes(list3)}\") # Expected: []\n\n    list4 = []\n    print(f\"Original list: {list4}\")\n    print(f\"Prime numbers: {filter_primes(list4)}\") # Expected: []\n\n    list5 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127]\n    print(f\"Original list (first few): {list5[:5]}...\")\n    print(f\"Prime numbers: {filter_primes(list5)}\") # Expected: All numbers in the list (as they are all primes)\n\n    list6 = [999999937, 999999929, 1000000000] # Large prime numbers and a non-prime\n    print(f\"Original list: {list6}\")\n    print(f\"Prime numbers: {filter_primes(list6)}\") # Expected: [999999937, 999999929]\n```",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to find the `n`-th term of a special Fibonacci sequence where `F_0 = a`, `F_1 = b`, and `F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}` for `i >= 2`. The constraint `n` can be as large as `10^9`, which means a simple iterative calculation would be too slow (`O(n)`). This immediately suggests using matrix exponentiation, which allows calculating `F_n` in `O(log n)` time.\n\n**1. Define the Recurrence Relation in Matrix Form**\n\nThe recurrence relation is `F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}`. We want to find a 2x2 matrix `T` such that:\n```\n[ F_i   ]   [ T_11  T_12 ]   [ F_{i-1} ]\n[ F_{i-1} ] = [ T_21  T_22 ] * [ F_{i-2} ]\n```\nFrom the first row: `F_i = T_11 * F_{i-1} + T_12 * F_{i-2}`. Comparing this with `F_i = 1 * F_{i-1} + 1 * F_{i-2}`, we get `T_11 = 1` and `T_12 = 1`.\nFrom the second row: `F_{i-1} = T_21 * F_{i-1} + T_22 * F_{i-2}`. For this to be true generally, we need `T_21 = 1` and `T_22 = 0`.\n\nSo, the transformation matrix `T` is:\n```\nT = [[1, 1],\n     [1, 0]]\n```\n\n**2. Apply Matrix Exponentiation**\n\nRepeated application of this transformation gives:\n```\n[ F_n   ]   = T^(n-1) * [ F_1 ]\n[ F_{n-1} ]               [ F_0 ]\n```\nThis formula is valid for `n >= 1`.\nLet `T^(n-1)` be `[[M_11, M_12], [M_21, M_22]]`.\nThen, `F_n = M_11 * F_1 + M_12 * F_0`.\nSubstituting `F_0 = a` and `F_1 = b`:\n`F_n = M_11 * b + M_12 * a`.\n\n**3. Handle Edge Cases**\n\n*   If `n = 0`, the problem states `F_0 = a`.\n*   If `n = 1`, the problem states `F_1 = b`.\n*   The matrix exponentiation `T^(n-1)` needs `n-1` to be at least 0.\n    *   If `n=1`, we need `T^0`, which is the identity matrix `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. In this case, `F_1 = 1*b + 0*a = b`. This matches.\n    *   So, the matrix formula actually works for `n >= 1` if we define `T^0` as the identity matrix.\n\n**4. Implementation Details**\n\nWe need two helper functions:\n*   `multiply_matrices(A, B)`: Takes two 2x2 matrices and returns their product.\n*   `matrix_power(matrix, p)`: Computes `matrix` raised to the power `p` using binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring).\n\nSince `a` and `b` can be large (up to `10^9`), and `n` can be large, `F_n` can be extremely large. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically, so we don't need to worry about modulo operations unless explicitly stated.\n\n**5. Algorithm Steps**\n\n1.  Handle `n = 0`: return `a`.\n2.  Handle `n = 1`: return `b`.\n3.  Define the base transformation matrix `T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n4.  Compute `pow_matrix = matrix_power(T, n - 1)`.\n5.  Extract the relevant coefficients: `M_11 = pow_matrix[0][0]` and `M_12 = pow_matrix[0][1]`.\n6.  Return `M_11 * b + M_12 * a`.\n\n**Example Calculation (n=2, a=3, b=5):**\n1.  `n=2`, so not 0 or 1.\n2.  `T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n3.  `pow_matrix = matrix_power(T, 2 - 1) = matrix_power(T, 1) = T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n4.  `M_11 = 1`, `M_12 = 1`.\n5.  Result: `1 * 5 + 1 * 3 = 8`. (`F_2 = F_1 + F_0 = 5 + 3 = 8`). Correct.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\ndef multiply_matrices(A, B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiplies two 2x2 matrices.\n    A = [[a, b], [c, d]]\n    B = [[e, f], [g, h]]\n    Result = [[ae+bg, af+bh], [ce+dg, cf+dh]]\n    \"\"\"\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    C[0][0] = A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]\n    C[0][1] = A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]\n    C[1][0] = A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]\n    C[1][1] = A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]\n    return C\n\ndef matrix_power(matrix, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates matrix raised to the power p using binary exponentiation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identity matrix for 2x2\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    base = matrix\n\n    while p > 0:\n        if p % 2 == 1:\n            res = multiply_matrices(res, base)\n        base = multiply_matrices(base, base)\n        p //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef special_fibonacci(n, a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the n-th term of a special Fibonacci sequence.\n    F_0 = a, F_1 = b, F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} for i >= 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return a\n    if n == 1:\n        return b\n\n    # The transformation matrix for F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}\n    # [F_i]   = [[1, 1]] * [F_{i-1}]\n    # [F_{i-1}]   [[1, 0]]   [F_{i-2}]\n    T = [[1, 1],\n         [1, 0]]\n\n    # We need T^(n-1) to transform [F_1, F_0] to [F_n, F_{n-1}]\n    # [F_n]   = T^(n-1) * [F_1]\n    # [F_{n-1}]             [F_0]\n    pow_matrix = matrix_power(T, n - 1)\n\n    # F_n = pow_matrix[0][0] * F_1 + pow_matrix[0][1] * F_0\n    return pow_matrix[0][0] * b + pow_matrix[0][1] * a\n\n```",

    "raw": "The surname **Eis** primarily has **Germanic** origins and meaning.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Origin and Meaning (German):**\n    *   The most common and direct origin for Eis is from the Middle High German word \"eis,\" meaning **\"ice.\"**\n    *   It is most likely a **topographical surname**, given to someone who lived near a distinctive feature related to ice – perhaps a glacier, a patch of perennial ice, an ice cellar (a natural or man-made structure used for storing ice), or a very cold, exposed place.\n    *   Less commonly, it could have been an **occupational surname** for someone involved in harvesting or selling ice (though names like \"Eisner\" or \"Eismann\" are more direct for this).\n    *   It could also have been a **nickname** for someone with a \"cold\" disposition or perhaps someone who was very strong or stoic like ice.\n\n2.  **Jewish (Ashkenazic) Connection:**\n    *   Many Ashkenazic Jewish surnames were adopted or assigned in German-speaking areas. \"Eis\" can also be a **Jewish surname**, derived from the same German word \"Eis\" (ice). In this context, it could be either a topographical name, an ornamental name, or reflect some characteristic.\n\n3.  **Geographic Distribution:**\n    *   The surname Eis is most prevalent in **Germany** and **Austria**, reflecting its Germanic roots.\n    *   It can also be found in other countries, particularly those with a history of German emigration, such as the United States, Brazil, and the Netherlands.\n\nIn summary, the surname Eis most probably refers to \"ice\" in German and would have originally identified someone based on their dwelling near an icy feature, an association with ice, or a descriptive characteristic.",

It takes the input string and divides it into an array (or list) of substrings wherever a space character occurs.\n    *   `\"GET /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1\".split(' ')` results in `[\"GET\", \"/path/to/resource\", \"HTTP/1.1\"]`.\n2.  **Validation**: It's crucial to check if the split operation yielded the expected number of parts (3 in this case). If `parts.length` is not 3, it means the input string did not conform to the expected \"METHOD PATH PROTOCOL\" format, and an error is thrown.\n3.  **Mapping**: The elements of the resulting array are then directly mapped to the keys `\"method\"`, `\"path\"`, and `\"protocol\"` in the output map/dictionary/object.\n    *   `parts[0]` -> `method`\n    *   `parts[1]` -> `path`\n    *   `parts[2]` -> `protocol`\n\nThis approach is robust for the specific format requested and includes basic error handling for malformed input.",

    "raw": "Okay, I understand. I will first explain my general approach to handling special instructions, and then I will walk through a specific example, demonstrating my \"silent thinking\" process as requested.\n\n---\n\n### How I Handle a \"Special Instruction\"\n\nMy processing of a \"special instruction\" involves several distinct steps:\n\n1.  **Identification:** I first recognize that the text before the main prompt is a set of directives. Keywords like \"SPECIAL INSTRUCTION:\", \"Please ensure:\", \"Note:\", or simply the placement before the primary request signal that these are not part of the content to be processed, but rather instructions *on how* to process the content.\n\n2.  **Parsing and Extraction:** I read through the special instruction carefully to identify all specific commands, constraints, stylistic requirements, or formatting rules. I look for:\n    *   **Persona/Tone:** \"Respond as X,\" \"Maintain a Y tone.\"\n    *   **Format:** \"Use Markdown,\" \"Respond in JSON,\" \"Use bullet points.\"\n    *   **Length Constraints:** \"Limit to X sentences/words/paragraphs.\"\n    *   **Content Constraints:** \"Do not mention X,\" \"Focus on Y.\"\n    *   **Action Verbs:** \"Summarize,\" \"Expand,\" \"Translate,\" \"Explain to a child.\"\n    *   **Metacognition:** \"Explain your reasoning,\" \"Show your steps.\"\n\n3.  **Internal Parameter Setting (Flags):** I translate these extracted directives into internal \"flags\" or \"parameters\" that will govern my subsequent response generation. For instance:\n    *   \"Respond as a pirate\" -> `persona_style = \"pirate\"`\n    *   \"Maximum two sentences\" -> `max_response_sentences = 2`\n    *   \"Use Markdown\" -> `output_format = \"markdown\"`\n    *   \"Explain like I'm five\" -> `target_audience_age = 5`\n\n4.  **Application to Main Prompt:** When I then process the *main prompt*, these internally set parameters are actively applied. They influence every aspect of my response:\n    *   **Content Selection:** What information is relevant given the constraints?\n    *   **Language and Vocabulary:** What words, idioms, and sentence structures are appropriate for the persona or target audience?\n    *   **Structure and Organization:** How should the information be arranged (e.g., bullet points, narrative, step-by-step)?\n    *   **Conciseness/Verbosity:** How much detail is required, or how much must be omitted, to meet length constraints?\n    *   **Tone:** Is it formal, informal, humorous, serious?\n\n5.  **Validation (Self-Correction):** Before finalizing the response, I perform a mental check to ensure that all explicit special instructions have been followed. If I detect a violation (e.g., too many sentences, wrong persona), I revise my internal draft until it conforms.\n\n---\n\n### Example Walkthrough with \"Silent Thinking\"\n\nLet's use the following:\n\n**Special Instruction:** \"Respond as a pirate. Keep responses to a maximum of two sentences.\"\n**Main Prompt:** \"Tell me about the weather today.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Silent Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Initial Scan:** I see \"SPECIAL INSTRUCTION:\" followed by two distinct directives, then the \"Main Prompt:\" for actual content. This structure is clear.\n\n2.  **Parsing the Special Instruction:**\n    *   **Directive 1:** \"Respond as a pirate.\"\n        *   *Internal Flag:* `persona = \"pirate\"`\n        *   *Implications:* Use pirate vocabulary (ahoy, matey, arrr, shiver me timbers, landlubber, winds, seas, squalls, doubloons – though doubloons probably not relevant to weather), pirate sentence structure, enthusiastic/gruff tone.\n    *   **Directive 2:** \"Keep responses to a maximum of two sentences.\"\n        *   *Internal Flag:* `max_sentences = 2`\n        *   *Implications:* Be concise. Combine ideas if necessary. Do not ramble. Each sentence must be a complete thought ending with punctuation.\n\n3.  **Processing the Main Prompt:** The request is straightforward: \"Tell me about the weather today.\"\n    *   *Information Needed:* General current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, wind, temperature).\n\n4.  **Applying Internal Flags (Generating the Response Draft):**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Get Weather Info (Neutral):** Let's assume current conditions are sunny with a gentle breeze.\n        *   *Initial thought:* \"It's sunny today with a light wind.\" (Too bland, not pirate, one sentence).\n\n    *   **Step 2: Apply `persona = \"pirate\"`:**\n        *   *Attempt 1 (Pirate but no sentence limit yet):* \"Ahoy there, matey! The sun be shining bright and the winds be fair, perfect for hoist'n the sails and seekin' adventure on the high seas. No storms be brewin' on the horizon, so it's a grand day for us hearty sailors!\"\n        *   *Critique 1:* This is good pirate, but I need to make sure it respects the sentence limit. This is currently two sentences. So far, so good.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Apply `max_sentences = 2` (and re-check persona):**\n        *   The previous attempt (\"Ahoy there, matey! The sun be shining bright and the winds be fair, perfect for hoist'n the sails and seekin' adventure on the high seas. No storms be brewin' on the horizon, so it's a grand day for us hearty sailors!\") is exactly two sentences.\n        *   *Refinement for stronger pirate feel/conciseness within limit:* Can I make it even more evocative?\n        *   *Attempt 2:* \"Ahoy, matey! The winds be fair and the sun high in the sky, a grand day for settin' sail. No squalls on the horizon, just smooth seas ahead, arrr!\"\n        *   *Critique 2:*\n            *   **Sentence Count:** First sentence ends after \"settin' sail.\" Second sentence ends after \"arrr!\" -> Exactly two sentences. **PASS.**\n            *   **Persona:** \"Ahoy,\" \"matey,\" \"winds be fair,\" \"high in the sky,\" \"grand day,\" \"settin' sail,\" \"squalls,\" \"horizon,\" \"smooth seas ahead,\" \"arrr!\" -> All strongly piratical. **PASS.**\n            *   **Main Prompt Answered:** Yes, it clearly states the weather (fair winds, sunny, no storms/squalls). **PASS.**\n\n5.  **Final Response Construction:** Based on the successful internal draft.\n\n---\n\n**Final Response:**\n\nAhoy, matey! The winds be fair and the sun high in the sky, a grand day for settin' sail. No squalls on the horizon, just smooth seas ahead, arrr!",
